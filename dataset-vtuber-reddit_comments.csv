1: dramabait. hololive sub is shutting down this topic, mafumafu already tweet to defuse. not worth keep digging this up.

Hololive sub always shuts down drama because that's literally their job. 

People have been allowed to talk about stuff here, and will still be allowed to talk about stuff here, provided it follows the rules. Is this post arguably baiting drama? Yes. Nevertheless, is the discussion centered around relevant current events? Also yes. 

Don't break the rules, don't call for people to harass or attack, don't harass people, and this stays open. As usual. 

1: Be nice!

Yes, be nice. 

1: this is basically DOXXING

Definition of dox

informal
: to publicly identify or publish private information about (someone) especially as a form of punishment or revenge

Talking about a discord notif popup when it comes up on a public stream is not doxxing. 

As per the established rules here (Rule 7), discussion regarding publicly available information of the person behind the avatar is allowed. If you dig up private information like their home address somehow, please tell me so I can ban you and report you to the admins. 

Don't break the rules, don't harass people, don't publish private information, use spoiler tags if necessary. 

1: holy fucking shit, people in the comments are actually defending the nutjobs who are harrassing Rushia

Actually most of the sentiment is recognizing that the harassment/attacks are absolutely not okay, you shouldn't call for it or do it, and that people should be able to recognize the need for an emotional detachment between themselves and an entertainer, and to have such a detachment. 

They're also recognizing that when your content trends towards utilizing this parasocial relationship, it will likely result in attracting individuals who cannot form this detachment in their emotional and social state. 

If anyone is calling for harassment, or is harassing someone, report them.

If shit goes real bad this thread gets torched.";negative;;508;926;189;1623
"This is what happens when Rushia fans and mfmf fans met unfortunately


Mfmf fans is famous for being extra toxic to anyone not name soraru since you know, gay idol stuff and all. Kinda like kpop stans with their idol


Now pair those two together and you got the recipe for disaster. Rushia gachikoi met mfmf rabid stans.";negative;;;;;
"Well damn it all!

I hope the best for both Rushia and MafuMafu and hope that they are able to get through this damned situation unscathed";negative;;;;;
Mafumafu has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/uni_mafumafu/status/1492037228520181760?s=21) about it just now, stating it is true that he has contacted Rushia last night, but they have only known each other through games and was only planning to ask if she was available to play games last night. He denied allegations of them living together, as apologize for causing confusions among fans and others.;negative;;;;;
"I think these two things can be true at the same time:

1. This shouldn't be happening and people should be able to emotionally detach themselves from internet personas no matter their content

2. If you do the type of content that leans heavily on and benefits from a parasocial relationship you must be aware that these are the types of people you will attract and you should have therefore known and accepted the risk involved along with the attention

We would like to be in a utopia but we shouldn't live pretending as if we are in one.";positive;;;;;
"There have been suspicions for a long time, and I think that the fact that Mi-chan = Rushia's previous life has had an impact.
Already, many of Lushia goods are being sold one after another on sites where people can buy and sell them privately.
If there is even the slightest suspicion about idols, paying customers will quickly leave.
Matsuri's incident with the suspicious person and Towa's incident with the intrusion of a male voice, both of which clearly decreased their popularity in Japan, will probably have some effect this time as well.
Probably the amount of super chat will be affected, that's for sure.
And because of the bad timing, the engagement ring merchandise was set to be sold, which gave a very negative impression.
It's even trending on Twitter, so I don't think the fuss will die down for a while.";negative;;;;;
"If it happened to anyone else it wouldn't be such a big deal. Rushia is probably the biggest ""gfe"" vtuber out there so there's a lot of drama now";negative;;;;;
"I'm scared, I won't lie. Mafumafu fans are absolutely terrifying and Rushia's not used to taking this level of heat, let alone for as long as this could last.

She needs to get away from Twitter and any other social media and stay away until this abates, for the sake of her mental health.";negative;;;;;
Just found out about all of this, this is a rollercoaster;negative;;;;;
"Mistakes are bound to happen and these two were the most unfortunate for this ""mistake"" to happen to.

mfmf and rushia have the most rabid fans and this collision is gonna be massive";negative;;;;;
"it's like every thing bad that could happen, happened.

Rushia, being one to play a ""girlfriend"" character who attract all sorts of nutjobs

Mafumafu and his fanatic female fanbase

Rushia being careless during streams (streaming her screen instead of capturing the application only, not turning off notification)

the unfortunate timing

so far, twitter has been rather quiet and more on the supportive side, not that i keep up with it closely

I imagine if this was another girl, it'd be bad, but not this bad. Say someone like Fubuki for example, there'll be drama, but can't imagine it being such car crash.";negative;;;;;
"She must be in a ridiculous amount of pain if he was actually just a friend that just wanted to play games, which seems likely cause it would be stupid of him to use discord if he was actually going to her

Even if they were actually together, this must be hard on her, no matter the type of content she has been putting out. Simply as another human being I hope she is fine";negative;;;;;
"Friendly reminder this same thing happens on the West too with both celebrities, streamers, influencers, etc.

Comes out that girl has BF and Parasocial Andys mald, with drama YouTubers being the leeches they are milking the situation antagonizing both the person and the audience in question for extra drama.

It's nothing new, nor anything specific to Japan.

Dumb people are dumb.";negative;;;;;
"I guess this is the thread?
Anyway, English summary of noteworthy points outlined in Korekore's stream 7 hours ago below. I tried to summerize them objectively without injecting my own viewpoints into them.
tldr: mafumafu and Rushia both talked/texted him about the situation and those are explained in the stream. Both denied dating, but admitted having gone on 1 dinner together before and plays games together few times a month. Rushia admitted liking mafu romantically and mistook his kindness for mutual feelings.
About Korekore: main content of his channel is exposing youtuber scandals through hosting voice calls of those involved and conversations from people asking him for advice. Opinion about him aside, he seems to have years of personally knowing these two so the info and his way of handling things should be somewhat trustworthy - but also with a grain of salt. My own check indicates all contents revealed here are either publicly available or stuff that is personally shared with him, and has a promise that he won't say stuff people told him but requested those to be private. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBlDJTC09SU
rushia told kore over phone call before the stream:
not dating
'confessed to mafu and went out on dinner/lunch together late last year (2020)'ù
'Right now we simply are friends that play apex together few times each month'ù
'Mi-Chan is the nickname I wanted him to call me'ù
'because he was so kind I thought maybe he had feelings for me or perhaps just for me'ù
'since we went out for dinner after I confessed my feelings that further made me think the feelings were mutual'ù
'The stream had windback enabled due to staff error that needs to remake stream to disable monetization for gtav'ù
'Am considering disappearing'ù
'Can't reply properly because agency is on holiday and stopped me from posting response on my own'ù
From KoreKore himself:
he has known the person behind Rushia on and off since the 2010s.
'After that dinner, Rushia asked Kore for advice on 'òI went out dining with mafu and seems like we can go all the way until just before dating () but when asked him about prior women stuff that went poorly into a quarrel. So if korekore know about mafu's secret with women please tell me' '
'Yeah actually 3 years ago ru liked mafu so much she bought all the same cups plates stuffed animals he had'ù
from mafumafu's discord DM to kore during stream: similar story of dining out and gaming together, thinks they were good friends, apologizes
'ùwe didn't talk for about half a year after the dinner'ù
from rushia's Line DM during stream:
'about the incident, do you want to talk about it'ù
probably not, sorry
'just about the notification?'ù
(my mental) is already all over the place
'even just do it for your fans?'ù
can't
really have to talk with lawyers
sorry about so far
Some thoughts on stuff he talked above:
It's not impossible that KoreKore felt the need to change the narrative to not get himself into trouble, and it's hard to know how accurate info from mafu and rushia are, but that's another matter, just don't blindly doubt or trust these things which is not the wisest.
Edit: formatting is hard.";negative;;;;;
This is why you don't encourage gachikois as a fan base;negative;;;;;

Bruh.";neutral;;;;;
"as a person who just learned this fiasco, Why didn't Mafumafu send a personal massage through WhatsApp/Line? I don't want to judge people preference, but if it's something personal, people would use WhatsApp and Line instead of Discord. a lot of youtubers and streamers I know always use WA for personal stuff, while Discord for hanging out (no personal story involved).

either way, Mafumafu has clear it up that they are talking about gaming/hanging out. and in my view, if you are a streamer/famous person, Discord is the last place you want to send a private message with in case of leak.";neutral;;;;;
yo mafumafu's a baller love that dude;positive;;;;;
Damn, thought i was going to be rushia's boyfriend. My heart is broken in a billion pieces. I guess no choice but to go outside and touch grass now. Wish me luck. Later bois! o/;negative;;;;;
this is why you should turn on Streamer Mode and Do Not Disturb every time you stream lmfao;neutral;;;;;
"Fault aside, I do feel like it's a bit of an indicator to Hololive that they may want to reevaluate their policies around Holomem's personal account management. I don't mean anything as brainless as ""They shouldn't have their own side channels/personal twitters/discord friends"" but this was a definitely avoidable issue if they enforced some stronger policies around making sure that work accounts are separated from private accounts.

There needs to be a proper bubble between private life and professional life, to avoid situations exactly like this. I see no reason why a holomem's ""professional"" discord account should have anything except other internal work accounts on it. This is basic operational stuff, particularly in a company where the talent's privacy is generally incredibly important ; and, in my opinion, the main reason Hololive can be so hands off with their talent's personal lives and relationships is because of this privacy existing. 

It means the company isn't constantly having to monitor the public image of the person beyond the character, just the character themselves. It's one of the undeniable best parts of virtual youtubing from a corporate perspective, as companies don't have to waste time and resources monitoring employees outside of work and employees get to enjoy their private lives. Obviously it's awful that idol companies feel the need to monitor employees out of work anyways, but vtubing as a technology is a compromise that let's talents actually live normal lives. 

And before anyone says ""They shouldn't have to!!!!"" I congratulate you on your empathy, and it's appreciated that you're a human that understands parasocial relationships aren't real, the simple reality is that ""shouldn't"" has nothing to do with it. People are freaks, it is what it is, but the damage done can be mitigated or avoided entirely if proper steps are taken. Cat's out of the bag on this one, but I hope this informs Cover and other Holomem's going forward on ways to prevent similar situations from happening again.";negative;;;;;
Gachikoi should calm down, and Rushia should stop GFE acting. I know it brings a lot of money, but is it worth living in fear that you're gonna get stabbed?;positive;;;;;
"Just my 2 cents: Rushia being just as clumsy(?) as usual, I imagined something would get leaked eventually. She is clumsy when it comes to streaming (at least as far as I have seen in Hololive) from forgetting to mute the mic on different occasions during stream for phone calls or after streams & forgetting to end stream(s) entirely. She been dancing around the danger line for a while now, the literal point of streamer mode in discord is exactly so DMs don't get leaked like this



but regardless to whoever needs to hear this, as some other people/comments, have said ""Ya'll need to touch grass"", I mean they're humans at the end of the day chill out and let their private life be exactly that... private";negative;;;;;
Encouraging GFE content to get that kind of fans Said fans went feral Surprised pikachu;positive;;;;;
"Wait, THAT mafumafu? The one with the original nyako and ""I wanna be a girl""?? If this is true, as both a Rushia fan and mafumafu fan, I'm honestly impressed.

I will still continue to support both of them as the cuteness factor has gone up tenfold.";neutral;;;;;
"I think the event does deserve a thread but this is a poor post on the situation OP. 

Instead of the original discord message, you post a wrong misleading translation of it.
You also bringing up 4 year old resolved drama without mentioning how that was resolved back then.

Also, it personally rubs me the wrong way how you mention that it's ""just a matter of time before someone get found out"" when it comes to hololive talent personal relationships. It really sounds like you think they are doing something bad for managing their personal situation however they want. Vtubers are unique in how it allows to protect the human behind the character, so if someone is a vtuber because of that, then that wish deserves more respect.";negative;;;;;
Vtubers should just stop the GFE shit. That way they avoid drama and crazy people in their fanbase, no matter how much money they get from it.;neutral;;;;;
i don't know what's true or what's false here but I hope the best for both of them;negative;;;;;
"Well shit. This will take a while to resolve, and its happen to rushia of all people, poor girl will be thorugh hell for the near future. Hope she got as much as support as possible. 


Allright lets put cynic glasses on. Frankly this whole controversy does not need to happen or even a problem for the first place. Yet human will be human people will get angry and I do understand their view point because I did has that parasocial tendencies early in my watching vtuber days. I manage to escape that but not all people are same, some might never move on from this.


Now after this happen let's look for the future. There are several possibilities for this. 
This sorted from the most easiest to do as rushia


1. She stop streaming full stop, the most painfull yet the most easy for rushia mentally escape from this life as vtuber. The problem will not stop immediately but it will put damper on anti wind and time will erase this incident.

2. She DENY everything and still streaming. her popularity will tank Hard. And the controversy will continue she need to take a tight ship for her fanbase and mod presence need to be at tenfold, this while also enduring harassment for at least a year or even her whole career as hololive vtuber. 

3. She admit it, yet continue streaming. This will be even more damaging to her fanbase and might make it explode. But if it survive they will more accepting for whatever she do in the future. Mafumafu also need to agree to this. 

Both 2 and 3 has same caveat she need to re-brand herself from GF experience vtuber. In 2 if she still doing it it will stoke fire to her hate fan and for 3 its just a bit too much even for me if she still act as GF even if I don't care about that. 

yet all 3 of that choice need rushia to be safe IRL. Now it's still incredibly dangerous for her, she need to move temporarily because doxer will find her. 

In the end I still wish rushia and cover to find other or 4 option or possibilities that work best for her. As I am just a powerless fan that could not help or have information to be useful for her. 

and lastly she just human same as us. Don't be asshole to other human being.";negative;;;;;
"One thing I think needs to be discussed is that the people upset aren't evil people. They are victims of social circumstances, and loneliness and depression. While that doesn't justify harassment, it is important to understand that they were sold a specific product that appeals to their mental illness and emotional vulnerabilities, and I think people need to take a step back and realize that even if you are not in their shoes, and even if you understand that GFE is at the end of the day fake, their emotional pain is still very real. They are angry because they are suffering, and not just because the person behind their virtual girlfriend might be in a relationship. It's the entire social circumstance. 

In reality they probably should be spending less money on vtubers and more money on therapy or something, ideally speaking. But depression's a hard hole to crawl out of. For some more than others. Anyone who is genuinely upset about this, I'm not making fun of them when I say they must have a sad life and I frankly truly feel sorry for them.";negative;;;;;
"The actual clip:
https://files.catbox.moe/z6c70m.mp4
The drama isn't just gachikoi and unicorns being gachikoi and unicorns;
Rushia's whole shtick is about the girlfriend experience, she went to great lengths for it, she said she want people to love her as one would love a girlfriend, checks people's twitter and gets angry at them if they twit about another vtuber acting like a jealous girlfriend, makes her fans swear they won't ""cheat"" on her with other girls. Her merch is an engagement ring. https://imgur.com/a/7s420Ww
She built her entire career around being a needy girlfriend and was in a way taking advantage of mentally ill people. So people are calling her out, some are threatening suicide, her biggest superchatter who donated above 30K USD had a breakdown all day yesterday
https://twitter.com/ORCA_fandead
This is more than anything a blow to the whole ""girlfriend experience"" act, for everyone, it's even more of a meme now, will Rushia even keep doing it?";neutral;;;;;
Idk, at this point, we can sum most Vtuber drama up as parasocial relationships bad. Well adjusted people know that a streamer is just a streamer, they aren't your friend no matter how much they read your username. Some amount of unadjusted people who can't tell the difference is inevitable as a streamer, but the streamer can definitely affect the percentage of their audience who are like that. I don't watch Rushia very much, so I can't attest personally, but reading this thread, she seems to really play into the gf experience. That inherently means she's going to attract more people looking for a parasocial relationship, and they'll become a large chunk of her most rabid fanbase. Now, she definitely has a right to be happy and date who she wants, but if your going to sell the gfe, you really have to be careful about keeping your private life quarantined away from your public persona. So some degree of blame lies with her for not taking proper precautions and cultivating a very parasocial audience, but most of the blame lies with the fans freaking out, who can't figure out that a streamer isn't their gf.;negative;;;;;
If people still care about this now is just ridiculous, not only it's highly likely some of the Hololive members have a boyfriend, some of them is highly likely already married.;negative;;;;;
A certain drunk feesh said that there's a lot of co-worker stories.;positive;;;;;
"I don't think they deserve what's happening, but they brought this on themselves with the fans they were fostering. Not like I have any right to judge them, though.
All of that aside, it was pretty dumb of Rushia to just have the notifications active while capturing her stream, but I guess she's shown before that she's not very knowledgeable about technology.";negative;;;;;
"Might as well give my 2 cents even if it's this late, being a Rushia fan for 2 years now and all.

This situation's a real shit show, and many of the comments here have already hit the nail regarding all guilty parties involved. As much as I enjoy Rushia's content, I can't really say I'm surprised about a situation like this suddenly blowing up. People with mental health problems exist, and they're all over the internet. This is a problem, especially in Japan (and many other Asian countries) where there is a stigma against mental health. That said, I'm relieved to see that the general majority of Rushia's fans are supportive and sane enough to not take her content too seriously.

Deranged and mentally unstable fans exist for all fandoms, this could happen to any of the other members, and in some cases, already have. Just so happens that Rushia has a more well-established fanbase and her content attracts the most of these type than the other holo girls, what with her yandere and mentally unstable persona and all. I won't say that she is intentionally exploiting her mentally unwell fans, she really does enjoy what she does and seems to care about them during the few times she breaks character. However, this does lead to content that leans heavily on GFE, and she is very successful at that (just look at her superchat numbers).

Based on my observations, there are many instances that point to Rushia not being in the best place mentally for some time now, and this is not just her playing a character. She did play with fire, given the higher percentages of nutjobs donating to her while having a different personality off stream. One of the more overt examples I can think of is her 'socially awkward' persona, despite many of the other holo girls implying otherwise. Again pretty common any entertainer to do, and bashers who claim that Rushia was 'manipulative' because of this need reality check at least, professional help at worst.

But who are we kidding, most of the outraged 'fans' are either those poor unstable men who fell into the GFE delusion and thinks Rushia somehow 'betrayed' them... or one of those rabid Mafumafu fans. Keep in mind that Mafumafu fans are notorious for being just as insane as the worst of K-pop stans, and have already gone after names like Lon and Ado. This unfortunately means that out of everyone, Rushia will be taking the brunt of the harassment. I can already tell that Rushia is suffering mentally, having already tweeted (and then deleting) about suicide in her alt account.

It only makes sense to say that she should have seen this coming for being careless, but I can't help but feel sorry that this has to happen to her. I just want to hear her banshee screams and make pettan jokes again man... but more importantly, I want her to feel better again. Whatever her decision is after this, I will keep supporting her.";negative;;;;;
"Yet another example of why sending your money to a content creator you like should be just that and nothing more. No expectations of a relationship or restrictions in their personal lives. 

Even the gachikois know this. They just choose to ignore it and spend all their cash anyway.";positive;;;;;
I know the situation is serious, but I am a bit amused by the fact that there is already fanart about it: https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/5120830;negative;;;;;
Hopefully this blows over fast and not affect her career, and mental health. Also insert Rent a Girlfriend meme here;negative;;;;;
"On top of all the drama, how the hell was the discord notification thing allowed to happen in the first place? 

If every manager (at Hololive and probably even other companies) hasn't already been having ""classes"" with their talents on how to silence notifications and the like, I can tell you they sure are now!";negative;;;;;
It's wild, I'm looking at it from an outside perspective since I'm not really a Rushia fan and don't even know who mafumafu is and the situation is fucked. Some people will claim the high road and say no one should care and while that's true and I agree the thing I find fucked up is that she literally has an engagement ring as merch that she just released lmao. Like cmon that's some fucked up morality, she straight up willingly played with fire and her fans.;negative;;;;;
Poor Rushia. I hope she can find a way to move past this and find comfort. I hate thinking how much this has effected her.;negative;;;;;
"I don't really watch Rushia content and I don't really care about GFE type of content.

All that being said, if your main content is GFE based and you continuously lean into it, you have to understand and accept that you run the risk of a massive blow up happening if you are in a relationship already.

I see a lot of people dunking on the fans for being losers and etc. But when you prey on a nerdy subculture that has a large majority of people that are single and/or lonely and you don't try to stop them or set boundaries, this was always going to be the end result. It's not just a case of ""touching grass"" or whatever. 

That's why you set those boundaries and make it clear that you love the fans but don't do stuff like telling them they're your wife/husband, selling fucking engagement rings and telling them not to look at other girls and etc. If you're not prepared for potential fallout, then do not do this type of content whatsoever. 

I feel bad for her in the sense that I don't want her to now break up with them if they are """"""allegedly"""""" together or her to graduate or anything like that. But I can't say that she or Hololive doesn't share the fault at all either.";negative;;;;;
"It is not our place to speculate what their relationship is, but there is something weird here for me, i mean why would mafumafu contact her through discord if they were dating for such a long time (since 2018), wouldnt they use line? 

But at the same time i find rushia unprofessional for letting her friends call her mii-chan. I thought big vtubers tried so hard to conceal their identities. So even if they are more than friends...him calling her like that is of course gonna raise questions.";negative;;;;;
"Damn, this might end pretty bad. In a ""normal"" situation Hololive fans would attack the guy, but it's Mafumafu we're talking about, he has some pretty intense fans too.

Edit: I wonder why I'm getting downvoted, I'm simply stating what happens in these situations. I think people who attack any of them are dumb and their relationship is not our business.";negative;;;;;
"GFE content preys on mentally ill men on the internet, anyone considering doing that sort of thing should think long and hard on the risk/reward.
It can work if you are painfully direct in breaking the illusion early and often but you're going to be feeding into fantasies of people that aren't mentally equipped to deal with it.
To an extent every popular streamer, especially women, have a small subset of possessive fans who fool themselves into believing they are a part of the streamers inner circle. But that becomes way worse when you actively feed into that delusion.
This is made even worse by trolls that know these people exist and know how to press their buttons turning a crappy situation into a dangerous one.
I hope this all blows over but the conversations that come from this are important and shouldn't just be swept under the rug by the fanbase. Which is something that happens often in Hololive.";negative;;;;;
Vtubers sell fantasy and mystery. Break this and people will most definitely be outraged, more so for both of them bc they cultivated gachikoi fanbases.;positive;;;;;
Huh I'm only vaguely aware of Mofumofu but he's cute and seems talented. If this was in my country this would be considered a super exciting couple, it would be nice if JP idols were given the same freedom;positive;;;;;
"I don't think it's anyone's fault really; the culture in Japan is just different. There is no solid proof that revealed that they are in an intimate relationship. I just hope Rushia, MafuMafu, and both sides of fans take care of themselves, and don't do anything extreme.";negative;;;;;
I wish Rushia and Mafumafu well in this drama, they don't deserve the hate they're getting;negative;;;;;
"So basicly it's Needy Girl Overdose in RL. Internet Overdose Ending with a bit of mental issue.

I don't get why this has blown up like it has.";negative;;;;;
"I will actually just copy-paste what I said in the r/Hololive SUB:

I mean!

Yeah, that goes without saying for most of us. Most people, even if they care a little, don't care enough to the point of doing anything too bad. Neither to the talent and nor to themselves.

~~Your post will get removed, by the way. That's just how this place goes.~~ I'm glad this place allows for discussions.

Anyways, if I can give my opinion real quick ~~before the post goes down:~~ Well, it did go down there.

~~I will be downvoted into oblivion here, but really, I think it needs to be said:~~ IMPORTANT NOTE - Even the Hololive community actually gave me awards for this take. For the first time in my damn life, I saw r/Hololive not fully defending a talent and accepting criticism. Even FULLY AGREEING with criticism. People who don't frequent that place don't get how big this is. It's just not natural for that place to accept anything other than positivity. The situation is so bad that even those people had to force some level headedness into themselves!

This situation is a hot mess precisely because, assuming it's all true, all three sides involved acted and are still acting in the most terrible way imaginable.

Yeah, I know, I'm blaming the person I shouldn't. I know that's what most will say. I am well aware.

But really!

Who do you usually blame when cassinos abuse their addicted gamblers?

Cassinos are illegal in many countries for a reason.

If this is true, it's undeniable that she took advantage of many weak minded folks. Be it her intention or not, this is merely what happened.

'Separating fiction and reality'ù is a weak argument. We all know it is. Keep repeating this is just hollow. The clear 'ùreality x fiction'ù distinction only truly exists when the soul behind the character is also fictional. And it goes without saying that this isn't the case for V-Tubers.

Mainly when Hololive talents are famous for dropping character within a month or so.

The person in question also didn't help. What kind of brain dead move was that? Sending a message in public space and expecting no one to see? Bro, what the fuck? Who uses fucking Discord for that?

As for the viewers, yeah, it's honestly just sad. I can't even blame them. They are just broken people 'ùrightfully'ù angry to finally realise that, as a metaphor, their Gacha game was just a scam all along.

Every side is at fault. Every side acted pretty much as terribly as they could. Everyone ended up being hurt.

If people could just be more transparent!

Like, c'mon, they aren't obligated to expose themselves. That's the point, and I fully understand it.

But if you are going to do a whole damn pretending game, then at least make sure that there's nothing that bad waiting for the weak minded ones to discover. What's lying behind your show must hold up at the very least to the point where copium addicts will be satisfied.

Maybe act like some talents that, as we know, keep denying the obsessive folks with notoriously frequent 'ùonly best friends'ù declarations.

Instead of going for the precise opposite path and mass encouraging this behaviour.

Don't even get me started on the fact that the fanbase of the dude is also crying a fuck lot. And this kind of fanbase (believe it or not) manages to be even worse than ours when it comes to overreactions.

What a shit show!";negative;;;;;

"I hate that the first response from Westerners is ""Why are they mad? They aren't gonna bone you bro"" is such a typical generalization people always make especially for Vtuber fans. Sure, there is that element that some fans are really infatuated with their oshis but it's more complicated than that. I never look at these situations as 100% black or white, Of course I don't think the 2 individuals deserve hate or stress, but there are layers to this and people shouldn't just assume that because in your culture it is a normal thing, that every other culture should be the same.";negative;;;;;
"The fact that those images are being shown as 'proof' that they live in the same space baffles me.

The first one is a cat scratching post. Of course they look similar, what else do they expect posts like that to look like!?

The second one, you can literally see the two cups have a different design.

The third one, the dog plush on the right, you can see the tongue of. You can't see the tongue of the one on the left, so again...totally different designs.

These people are psychopaths.";positive;;;;;

"Although I wish this came into light in a better way, this was bound to happen at some point in companies like Hololive

People need to realize that these girls have lives of their own. Parasocial relationship is fine and all, but to become to obsessive and believe they actually own you something, like giving up their own livelihood? It's psychotic. 

I don't know Mafu but judging by the comments here, the fans are something to worry about. I just hope this plays out well.";negative;;;;;
"This whole situation is none of our business as fans, and everyone who thinks otherwise is delusional. Whether they are. Whether they're not.

If any other streamer had a BF in real life it won't be an issue, but the problem with Rushia herself is that she built her streaming career and superchat empire out of GFE. This was a person who was willing to act like a yandere to provide mentally ill and lonely people (unicorns, gachikoi) a sense of companionship - the role also requires the vtuber to be a pure idol, so having an IRL bf destroys the immersion. As a result, what Rushia did came off as a manipulator taking advantage of vulnerable people to make herself rich, all while betraying them at the side. People can actually commit suicide out of this. If Rushia was indeed exposed as a manipulator, what she is doing is just evil.;negative;;;;;
"I think it's a good thing to have someone you can lean on if things get dire. ""No man is an island"" and all that.";positive;;;;;
"I'll add news that just happened yesterday.


Last night Mafumafu went to twitcast to explain everything.
-He apologizes for lying to his fans (about not interacting with women) 
- He proceeds to show DM's from Rushia's ""roommate"" account, (with her consent and permission) and it shows Rushia apologizing to him for the 2018 incident, Mafu said that it's okay and that he's the one who should be apologizing because it was his cutlery that was almost the same as her's in the first place.
-He reveals that he got them from his fans (as a coincidence) and that nothing happened between them, they just became friends and played Apex last summer.
- He apologizes one final time for causing trouble and ends the stream.
- Rushia streams on her roommate twitcast account a day after his stream, and says ""Everyone/everything is so cruel. Please check your phone. Goodbye."" (she ended the stream herself, which shows that she's still alive, but in a bad mental state)

-Mafu and Rushia's fans have started blaming and attacking each other. 

- It's still pretty bad on twitter right now.
Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone.";negative;;;;;
Jeez some people really just can't set boundaries. I've been watching Hololive streams for almost 2¬Ω year now and I always make sure to not get myself emotionally attached to any Hololive vtuber that I watched. I got my favorite too but I'd rather have them had a partner for real.;negative;;;;;
I took out a second mortgage on my home, and eventually sold it off and went into massive debt to give Rushia a monthly allowance in SC donations. I went from having my own 3 bedroom home, with 2 cars and a dog, to living in squalor, in a tiny room, eating nothing but top ramen and Burger King ketchup packets for 2 years, while stealing my neighbor's cat food so my dog could eat, just to be able to provide a comfortable life for her until the pandemic is over, and we can finally be together. She always read my SC and told me I was her only one. How could this happen?! To think that someone else is nibbling the beautiful cherry blossom petals on MY Necromancer's pettan bumps... while I'm reliving myself to the same clips of her screams and tears. Why did things have to turn out this way?! I've never been so betrayed...;negative;;;;;
Y'know, thinking about it, the situation is very clearly indicative that they're not in a relationship. If they were, wouldn't he have known her schedule, knowing she's busy streaming, and not bugged her? If they were, wouldn't he have known the ramifications of a slip-up and been more careful about how he addresses her? I'll choose to believe surely he wouldn't have been inconsiderate enough to not be aware of her activities and risk putting her in a compromising position, having only done so because clearly they're not actually all that close.;negative;;;;;
Shouldn't sell engagement rings if you have a boyfriend, or at least be careful;positive;;;;;
"My take.

People deserve to have a normal life and relationships outside of their occupation, entertainers included. The original message that sparked this is beyond blown out of proportion and only really serves to prove just how bad these fans are right now.

Obsessive fans are creepy and delusional, but are also very much taken advantage of at the same time. Rushia, with Hololive's support definitely farms these types of fans for as much money they can get out of them, fueling the flames of their behavior and are now finally getting burned. I can think of so many examples I feel like I'd need to make a more detailed post explaining my thought process behind it.

Even with this incident, I predict nothing significant will change in the grand scheme of things. Whether or not people forget about it in a week, or it forces a Rushia graduation. Maybe other ""GFE"" type streamers will lay low for a bit, and then resume regularly scheduled business.";negative;;;;;
"Tbh, I don't know why nobody is doing copium with ""its a Discord guys, not Line. They're not so close to exchange line yet"". 

I think its because there are already seeds before that any small fuel (like dude, its just a message of just arrived at home), inflame the situation alot harder.

But then again, this situation kinda happens because its Rushia. If you changed Rushia to Pekora or Miko, it will become a joke-y situation instead. If you change it to Choco... people may bless him since she's leading quite unhealthy lifestyle. The reason why this happened to her, is because she's the type of content creator who somewhat cultivate those kind of people, and have big enough size for it to actually have tons of people stirring things up. I don't condone harrassment.... and I feel for Rushia especially since this happened over weekend, but its not like I don't understand the other side (even if they're somewhat incels too) and I do think this only happened because this is her and reason is because of her content.";negative;;;;;
"It's getting pretty bad on Rushia side. Mafumafu's fan either chill about the situation or going after Rushia. Rushia's fan on the other hand, either chill about the situation or also going after Rushia. Honestly I'm sick of this ""stan culture"" or ""idol culture"" or whatever it is called.";negative;;;;;
Why would Rushia be setting this up? That rumor makes zero sense unless she is looking for a reason to graduate but still makes no sense...;negative;;;;;
"I never thought I would get so invested in this drama but here is my take

She should take a step back and rethink how she presents herself to her audience. I think she should form a well made video on her relationship with that guy. (I think turning their marriage into a running gag is a good way to dodge it while making a boundery.) then she should take time to tell her audience what she will do in the future. she should tone down the Rushia character and maybe take time each stream to show her hand in the creation of Rushia. She should also apologize for feeding into GFE, not creating a safer environment, and neglecting the present issues. After that she should work to refund those who got hurt. And Create rules for future donations. 

The thing I noticed about Hololive and Japan is that they dodge the uncomfortable real life shit. If Hololive wants to protect their talents they need to establish a boundary between the streamer and fan, and they need to directly apologize for creating a toxic environment or at least neglecting Rushia's growing parasitic fanbase. A lot of people and companies let these issues fester to maintain their image.";negative;;;;;
"I may have a controversial opinion so down vote me to oblivion if you disagree, that's you're right. But I have a mix of opinion 1 and 2, that is this having a bf thing is something completely fine and why tf are people so weird, but also having watched rushia streams and clips, almost all of them have her act out an obsessive girlfriend persona. While a sane person will obviously know the difference between fiction and reality, it would be naive to think that people with absolutely no social skills and a warped sense of reality are not also present in the fanbase. Have you used the Internet. I don't 'blame' Rushia or Hololive for this, but I somewhat think it was the deal with tje devil that they made. This was intentionally cultivated to gain money, explaining why Rushia is one of the top superchatted since she debuted till today. Win win for all, except of course the schizos who view parasocial relationships as serious. I'm not one of those against parasocial relationships btw. Just saying there are consequences to these things.

I think there are a number of ways this could go after this. Maybe Rushia will even do an apology and some punishment suspension like Towa did when the male voice thing happened to her in apex. Hololive seems to love doing that, in line with the idol culture as well. Or another course of action, Hololive sticks up for her because of the amount of foreign and non gachikoi fans which are now supporting her and are saying the situation is bs.

Tdlr: Toxic idol culture is something they capitalised on but that doesn't mean the weirdos response is socially acceptable. Hope Rushia and hololive get through it.";negative;;;;;
Hope this get swept under the rug like what happened with towa. Probably rushia needs an active mode going forward that can delete comments and ban people that mentioned this again in the future. Just feared that she'll do a dragon and choose to step away from hololive.;negative;;;;;
"In all honesty i just want her to come back having fun playing games, talking shit with her friends, sing amazing songs, and have her tell me she'll stab me every once and a while since she's the absolute best at making that funny.

Ive seen the smallest consequences these situations can have and also at its absolute worst.

Who knows when she'll come back at full power. It took Towa nearly half a year to fully come back confidently, but that situation was different. I just hope this doesnt effect her passion to create content. But knowing how supportive the talents are over there i think she'll be fine.";negative;;;;;
"Part of me would disagree with saying she deserves it but another part of me would agree considering she plays heavily into the whole GFE (And Mafumafu with BFE but i don't know him at all, that's just what people say) entertainment and while i'm sure most people are able to understand it's just an act, this type of content is bound to bring out the more unhinged people and it sucks that both Rushia and Mafumafu are getting so much flack for this. The only thing i can say for certain is that neither side deserves to get harassment over this

I just hope in the end of the day this doesn't affect either of them too much and they don't get too much harassment because honestly this all just seems like a whole bunch of nothing. Let's be honest, if anyone ever thought they had a chance with Rushia/Mafumafu then idk what to tell them

Best case scenario, i hope this all blows over peacefully and Rushia plays less into the GFE experience (And while i'd say Mafumafu too, again i don't watch him so idk what his content is actually like) because while they rake in cash, as we can see from this situation, it's just not worth it. Granted realistically i don't know if Rushia can even still play into the GFE experience even if this blows over because you best believe there's probably shit-stirrers or antis going to hold onto this for ammunition if she does go back to GFE stuff";negative;;;;;
the dark side of the idol-culture rears its ugly head again. I hope they're both safe.;neutral;;;;;
"Wonder what the fallout of this would be? Hope nothing bad comes out of it but knowing some of Rushia's fans, this might turn a bit ugly.

And anyone who thinks that what they're doing is similarly creepy gets shouted down

All these ""support"" of ""Rushia can have a boyfriend if she wants"" is literally counterintuitive and only serves to widen the gap between rushia and whoever this mafu guy is. Literally best thing everyone can do right now is to literally shut up about it and let the two work it out behind the scenes.";negative;;;;;
I couldn't care less about them dating, if anything I'm more mad at Mafumafu's professionalism. Why the hell is he messaging her on discord in the first place? Don't people use Line or literally anything else over there in Japan? And even if you wanna use Discord, use your personal account! Now all the blame/focus are on Rushia, including Mafumafu's toxic fan base. Guy made a stupid mess and the girl has to bear most of the burden, this is fucking bullshit.;negative;;;;;

Honestly after this drama i can't view Rushia stream as same as before. I never intent to dig in vtuber's personal to avoid breaking character setting but this drama is just hit on my face lol . I though her little younger but it end up she is much older , thousands year old necromancer indeed . It's kind of unprofessional but i hope Rushia get well pass this drama . But the damage is done and things can't be same as before.;negative;;;;;
Her private life is and should be private. And I hope as a person that she will find her special someone. She entertain us, but she isn't our girlfriend and never will. Parascocial relationship are strange...;negative;;;;;

"So i'm just now seeing this drama, and as a proud gachikoi, people need to grow the fuck up.

Even if Rushia and MofuMofu are in a relationship: It doesn't fucking matter because that's their personal lives, and fans on both sides need to get over themselves because creators don't owe them anything except the content they create. It goes to say it's not just JP bros here, we JUST went through a similar situation with Mori Calliope and CDawgVA and that was some fucked up bullshit.

My only concern is Hololive/Cover Corp. I'm hoping they are 100% behind Rushia's back and any other holomember's back over this. The thing about Idol Culture I hate worse than obsessive fans are agencies that restrict idols from having their own personal lives and relationships. They aren't objects and have every right to their own autonomy separate from their work.";negative;;;;;
Why do we need threads detailing every detail of her real or imagined personal life going back three years? Whatever she does outside of her job as a vtuber is none of my goddamn business. If she wants to reveal personal details it is one thing, but since she doesn't can we just leave it alone?;negative;;;;;
"Oh man both of these fanbases are pretty hardcore about who they interact with, this is really gonna be a shitshow, and right on valentines eve oof.

While i dont really care about Rushia's streams since GFE creeps me out, i hope this doesnt cause her to stop streaming since most people in the west dont care.";negative;;;;;
I really hope that the hate about this situation dies soon. They really do not deserve hate just because of this. They are human behind their Vtuber avatar.;negative;;;;;
Damn I wish Asian celebrities could just date and not have it be a big deal yo. This kind of social stigma just points to, and reinforces really disturbing aspects of the culture.;negative;;;;;
"Good for them if there going out. 
Sucks that some of her fans can't seperate her Character and private life.";negative;;;;;
You play with fire you get burnt. In 2022, more people are alone and facing mental health challenges. Rushia and the guy both built fandoms preying on those people. They didn't set boundaries, hell they both sold engagement rings. So I don't feel sorry for either of them getting flammed for this. I hope those guys find help, but looking at replies it's more likely there only gonna get pushed into a darker place.;negative;;;;;
"Honestly, now that the situation has died down a little, what scares me the most is the silence from Rushia... mainly because of a 'ìnow deleted'ì tweet on her 'ìnow deleted'ì personal account about (Warning: DeepL translation ahead) ""sleeping better.""

Don't these guys know that this is NOT RL and we just watch idols to destress from work stress or whatever stress? Same as playing your games or watching tv shows/movies.

"Looking at these comments, So much for the whole 'Second life/Past life talk is talk is taboo'ù idea. Mafu's comments seemed to me like more than enough info for the fans. Anything beyond that is none of our business.

Cause newsflash, chances are most vtubers you watch are active with their own relationships in their personal lives. That's just being an adult.";positive;;;;;
"But you're kinda missing the whole point lmfao. You realise rushia signed up for this job. Their target demographic is lonely single men because they have the most money to spend. She's played a persona in which she's your pure oshi gf. She attracts these kinds of people on purpose and has made a crazy living off it. You can hate on all the people donating but the reality is she's making a lot of money for playing this GFE. 

Now being an idol doesn't just come with its benefits without the negatives. The obvious one being you can't have a bf or atleast publicly. Why? Because it ruins the entire GFE persona that they purposely build. If people knew 100% they are in a relationship irl, do you think they would still be donating in the tens of thousands? It makes sense why people would be mad at her. (Not that it's her fault he messaged her mid stream) 

Overall I personally hate idol culture since it doesn't make sense to me. The fans would never actually be in a position to be in a relationship with their idol and they know that. Yet they keep filling their fantasies of it. And these 'idols'ù just reap all the money that comes with people being lonely until they are found out and then it's onto the next idol. The real overarching problem is with loneliness in Japan and really everywhere else for that matter. Rip orca and his 35k";negative;;;;;
"Please let me vent out my thoughts about this incident.

I'm probably not going to watch Rushia's ASMR or Cooking stream or Tee tee videos from now on. Am I delusional and crazy? No. I am well aware that idols have their personal lives and such. But at the very least I wanted them to keep their ""image"".

If this happened say to someone like Korone, who just portray themselves as a cute gamer doggo, then no problem since I watch Korone because of that image of her. Hell, even if it turns out that Watame is already married with 5 kids, I'd still watch her. But for Rushia who literally advocates herself as a cute yandere girlfriend, feels weird bro. Say she does collabs, release an original song or cover or stream some random game stream, then yeah I'd still dig that, but for her to keep pretending to be your tee tee girlfriend is something that will be very cringey from now on. I am not going to watch someone pretend to be my girlfriend while I am fully aware that that person has a boyfriend irl. Ignorance is bliss.

"Neat. None of my business, so I will only say, ""Good for them.""";positive;;;;;
"I do not understand the replies here blaming Rushia for this or suggesting she was asking for this kind of trouble.

It has always been very clear that the ""girlfriend"" thing is schtick just like the ""necromancer"" thing is. Even if it's done with the intention of being a comfort to fans who'd like it, it was never perceivable as real by anyone with any sense.

Being critical of her for that isn't as toxic as the unicorns, but not seeing her intent isn't helpful.

She seems to be a genuinely sensitive person, and I hope that the love poured out for her can help her to bounce back quickly.";negative;;;;;

The people getting mad at this need to go outside and touch some grass. She's a streamer at the end of the day and her job is to entertain the people that watch her.

"I wish I had words in my brain to really say something smart about the situation but my brain is empty at the moment.

Lets look at the facts of the situation.

People are all excited about a scandal, rratters going to rrat, haters going to hate, white knights going to white knight and the rest of the general populace will most likely forget that this happened 2 weeks from now.

A lot of what I'm saying has been written over and over again on this post and in other places but the events that are going to happen next is going to be pretty predictable in the next coming days.

Rushia exists in the virtual world, She's an ageless necromancer with green hair and what not. She does not have a love interest because one doesn't exist in the hololive timeline.

Lets break the 4th wall for a second and for the sake of simplicity, lets call the person behind Rushia, Uruha.

Whether or not they're dating or not, the conversation that mafu2 had was with Uruha, not Rushia. For any company, they're going to draw the line there.

I'm not sure how the idol industry works in Japan, but if they're contractually obligated to not have any boyfriends, then that's a breach of contract. But, if that rule is in place then there's a big elephant in the room regarding talents having love interest amongst themselves even if that is more ""acceptable"" to the idol culture if you're really talking about inclusiveness and equality. That's a differen't topic for a different time that's semi related to this but I don't really want to get into.

Depending on the response and harrassment that might come from this I can probably see cover letting Uruha take a mandatory break until stuff dies down.

Anything past that, no one really has any control over. So why worry about it? You can try to control the narrative on official forums, but that just means, it will slide down to other discords and shadier places.

Again, there is no official love interest for Rushia in hololive's story line for the character so any kind of damage control and PR should probably have to be done on the side of Uruha. Honesty is probably the best policy in that case, but people will hate you for telling the truth and would rather live in a lie than wake up, but that's not a healthy relationship imo. Either that or staying silent.

There's nothing that can't be said if it at the right timing, the right context, and with the right selection of words.

As for me, who people choose to be close with honestly should be between those two people and not anyone else's decision. If they decide that they want to share regarding that relationship, that's awesome, everyone has to remember that ultimately it's the couple's decision to be together that they're together.

That's probably the extent of what I have to say about the matter.";negative;;;;;
Do these fans really believe that there is 0% chance their oshis aren't in a relationship or interested in getting in one? They are people and like everyone they catch feeling and want to fall in love.;negative;;;;;
"Actually it surprised me in a positive ways how little traction the seems to be getting in the western audiences. I am not sure how bad it might be within the japanese fandom, I assume it is a hundredfold worse.

It's a good ocassion to remind gachikois that vtubers are not your girlfriends, they are not even your friends, they are entertainers. Surely you can admire and like many aspects of them, and enjoy their company, but they are real people with real lives. Keep that in mind if you decide to support them with memberships or superchats so you do not feel betrayed, they are professionals.

It's more like Hololive reaping what they sow. To get profit from GFE.

If you're genuinely malding because Rushia (or really any holo person, live or stars) has a relationship with the opposite gender, platonic or romantic or any other kind, please go outside and touch grass, breathe fresh air, and go reconnect with objective reality. Talk to people, real people. You give the majority of the sane fans a bad name with your schizo antics and do nothing but cause drama for the talents and fans. Put bluntly, you're the problem and you should feel bad.;positive;;;;;
The hololive fan server is such trash with this. Any a problematic topic come up with a HL streamer they enforce a culture of silence and non-acknowledgment on legitimate news about a given stream.

The mods take their rule 4 way too far, and I wish something could be done about it.;negative;;;;;

"It sucks they have to deal with those fans because a couple of messages were accidentally shown. I always thought that it was easier to detach the streaming persona to the actual person when it's a Vtuber since you don't actually know what they look like. Though I guess loneliness is a hell of a drug, I hope everything turns out fine and nobody does anything extreme because of it.

Edit: I've been informed people know her real face, my point still stands though. Nobody who watches her really know her personally and shouldn't think she was their actual girlfriend.";negative;;;;;
Vtuber simp mfs so bored they see a silly discord notif and instantly start rratin;negative;;;;;
"This is what it means to be an ""idol"" in Japan.

Many idol groups, including AKB48, have officially announced that they have a ""no love rule"". 
If they find out that you have a boyfriend, you will be forced to leave the group immediately.

One of the members of the most popular male idol group announced his marriage after hiding the existence of his girlfriend for 25 years until the group broke up.

Strange, I know, but that's what idols do. 
Cover should have been more careful about how they manage their idols.

I don't know what will happen in the future, but anyway, I hope she will be okay.";negative;;;;;

"Parasocial criiiinge

That said, I know hololive is an idol agency but man, be careful so that you don't develop a one-sided relationship

I advise everyone to watch the ""I am not your friend"" video from Ludwig; it's a good vid on the topic of parasocial relationships";negative;;;;;
"Lol selling wedding ring to his viewer and go dating with someone else. NTR experince for

Looklike hololive talent it just bussines perspective for now, but iam enjoy the content rushia hahaha";positive;;;;;
The 'coming home' thing almost definitely doesn't mean living together. I would honestly be extremely shocked if isn't in Hololive's contract that you can't live with men other than family, considering they are signing up to be idols and they stream from home. You couldn't keep the business going this long unless you banned male voices in the house.;negative;;;;;

"Not endorsing any kind of harassment, but it was extremely unhealthy and irresponsible for anyone to assume any kind of streaming personality would stay ""pure"" for them no matter what they say, and it is irresponsible for any streaming personality to cultivate a GFE/BFE experience in their streams. 

Always assume whoever you're watching is getting fucked on the regular, because it is probably true. Don't offer an engagement ring (lmao) as your merchandise.";negative;;;;;
"This is genuinely sad. They need to understand that who they like is the persona in the screen, not the one behind it.

Because they are two different people.";negative;;;;;
Rushia is a person first... What she does in her private life is her own damn business leave her be;neutral;;;;;
Sad that this is happening. Are we humans so immature that we have to make other miserable over things like this? Sad for everyone involved. Hopefully Russia isn't punished for this.;negative;;;;;
I really don't understand how people can be so invested in vtubers that this gets them mad. Like, it's not even a real person on the screen. The ladies are playing characters.;negative;;;;;
The only thing I can think to lessen the hate for this drama is to release their discord conversation to prove that they are just going to play then have someone credible enough to validate if it is edited or not. Idol culture sure is a toxic behavior, damn.;negative;;;;;
it rushia what you expect never like her lol;positive;;;;;
I don't even really think they're dating, gachis just misconstrued the whole thing imo;negative;;;;;

I dont want to peer into this more closly cuz idk their private life and ill let them be but even if they are dating I'm happy for them I think they would be quite sweet for them to be together honestly and even if their not its fine I just hope they ok;negative;;;;;
"I don't see a problem with a vtuber being X, Y or Z's girlfriend. That's perfectly fine. Inuyama Tamaki for example was known to be involved with a man since a long time ago. Today that man is her husband and when she told her fans that they decided to start a family, many fans gave even more support because 'baby fund' and 'families are expensive'.

What is NOT fine is if/when a vtuber tells her fans one thing but turns around and does the opposite. That's practically the definition of betrayal. 

I don't know the details in full about Rushia's involvement with whomever or her breach of contract but what I do know is that if she had been honest from the start, none of this would have happened. That is the lesson that must be learned and hopefully, other vtubers won't make the same mistakes.";negative;;;;;
Just be happy Rushia is happy, who cares if and who she's in a relationship with? None of our business.;positive;;;;;
Another week, another idiotic drama. I'm glad Vtuber fans continue to make me absolutely ashamed to participate in this community in any form.;negative;;;;;
this isn't a situation, they have lives you incels.;negative;;;;;
Idol culture is gross and people need to go touch grass. There are living people behind vtuber avatars that have their own lives, leave it at that.;negative;;;;;
"People going around saying ""Well Rushia was doing GFE so she had it coming"" are ridiculous. Can you imagine if the roles were reversed, if Rushia went to a fan's house and stabbed them because they were watching another streamer? And then her defense was: ""I told you on stream so many times I would do this, so my fandead were asking for it.""";negative;;;;;
"I really do not get the controversy?

Like, do people genuinely believe that when Rusia or any vtuber reads a super chat or something, that they're actually talking to you personally? Because they are not.

We are all a bunch of nameless, faceless chat members, that's all we are and all we ever will be. Seeing people say shit like ""she deserves it for leading us on"" and the like really concerns me. Even without watching her streams (not a big fan of her personally) I can guarantee that she never actually did anything to ""lead us on"", because honestly, how could she? The only thing she could really do to lead us on is say something like ""if I ever meet any single chat member irl, they are automatically my boyfriend for the day"", but she didn't.

Saying things like ""they accept the responsibility when they sign on"" is absurd. They didn't accept anything like that. They agreed to play video games and such to entertain us, that's it. Do not blame or harass ANY vtuber because you cannot differentiate reality and fantasy, and because you think the anime girl on YouTube actually genuinely loves you. Sure, you can send her a chat saying ""goodnight, I love you"", and she can respond the same way, but if you truly believe that she means it, then that is 100% on you. Not her. What, if someone gives a non-vtuber like Vinesauce $10 and tells him to say ""I'm gonna cum"", like, do you think he's actually doing that??

Can't we just watch anime girls play video games and have that be the end of it?";negative;;;;;
And what if they are together? Why does it matter so much? Nobody, no not even you reading this would ever end up with Rushia, and you know it, instead, she ended up with such a nice guy like Mafumafu, that even I personally like. I watch both of them, and Mafumafus song saved my life. If Rushia wouldn't choose Mafumafu (assuming she is with him) she could also choose some old fat hairy guy, and would that make you happier? This is the best day of my life since two people I love so much might be dating, and you should be happy as well, and stop those fucking assholes harassing them.;positive;;;;;
"I'm interested to see what type of content Rushia will do after this mess is over.
Ngl, I don't like Rushia because of her simp pandering.
I still remember when Holostars channels showed on her stream and she was obsequiously apologizing over it. It disgusted me.";negative;;;;;
If one is a Hololive vtuber, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER put non-work contacts on your work devices. It's that simple. Have a second set of devices for personal communications and this would never happen.;neutral;;;;;
Their life should not be dictated by others. If she wants to start a relationship so be it. I don't watch her because I am sexually attracted to her. If that is what you see when you are watching someone's content you should really seek help. They work so hard to create a persona for their character that least you can do is cut some slack off them.;negative;;;;;
"Psychos gonna psycho, haters gonna hate.

Either way, they can live their lives how they want.";negative;;;;;
"I think Veibae summarized it pretty succinctly. Most streamers do in fact have a significant other. But like anything else they keep it separate. Like Tectone and Fream when they meet with Vienna etc.

These are real people behind the avatar. Just enjoy the content and try not to be a psychopath.";neutral;;;;;
"I fucking hope they got relationships! God I would quit my job if they forced me to pick.

What do you guys think about that video where KoreKoreCh, that knew Mafumafu and Rushia way before she became a vtuber, actually confirms they are dating ? https://youtu.be/49tO5gMzoI4;positive;;;;;

They are both cats and dogs but the design is not even similar and honestly looks like generic stuffs you can buy from amazon or 100 yen stores.

Come on now... Realistically, how many people have piano and black cat themed glasses? That is such a specific design that it basically confirms the whole thing.";negative;;;;;
"Now imagine if this happens to other members like Nene.. now thats a big drama. 

This is why Hololive must change their industry from Idol to just streaming. I understand everything about Rushia being a person, but sadly this is the result of the fans she made on her content. And in the worst possible time (never know she released engagement ring and all that). Maybe ir was a mistake, maybe it was planned. Only they know the truth. But the damage is done, and it depends on them how to approach this situation. I really enjoyed Russia's reactions on the clips... Best of luck on both of them, they will really need it.";negative;;;;;
The grossest part is the idea these people have to hide their relationships for fame;negative;;;;;
"if only mafumafu stop being a dick and messaged Rushia in LINE or something smh

now Rushia's GFE career is almost certainly done";neutral;;;;;
Never liked idol culture. I mean, i love the contents but not the entire culture. It can be weird and disgusting sometimes.;neutral;;;;;
"I'm reading some of the things in this thread about how Rushia is partially responsible but i feel like no!? She isn't? 

Because reasonableness is no matter how many fantasies a person you pay indulges you in, that is paid for and not real. For a lot of you it seemed that the 'GFE'ù bothered you or annoyed you and that's why you seem to shift the blame to her but again it's a paid service that her whole brand is. 

Some people are talking about boundaries as if the barrier where you're not taking to her personally ever and you're not living with or looking at her isn't enough of a boundary.";negative;;;;;
mfmf is faking it and just wanna watch rushia and hololive burn to the ground? That plot seems way interesting;neutral;;;;;

But sadly Japanese fans usually got no chill for these thing so we should expect some bloody news shows up probably in this week
As a fans from outside japan we all should probably support them as much as we can like give some support comment to their respective youtube or social media, most Japanese sucks at English so this ""gachikois"" people, most of them at least wont bother us in argument";negative;;;;;
"As western vtuber fans, unburdened by ""purity "" culture. It is time for us to step up and show support for Rushia.";positive;;;;;
I don't think mafu mafu is rushias boyfriend, because I thought that when you enter the idol business you had to give up being in a relationship until you graduate(thats just the standard over in the idol business) Which is why these 40+ vtubers never had(or I dont think so) a boyfriend while working with hololive. Of course this is just all my speculation and I could be totally wrong but this is just what I know(maybe).;negative;;;;;
Honestly it blows my mind how this is even considered an issue. Anyone watching these streamers should understand that they do not have any kind of a relationship with them, no matter how much of a 'girlfriend'ù aesthetic they lean into. This is entirely on these rabid viewers who don't get the concept of boundaries and that _these streamers don't belong to them._ It's frankly disgusting to see this kind of behavior be so widespread and I hope this becomes a wake-up call for many that their obsessions are unhealthy.;negative;;;;;
"I cannot understand how toxic is that culture, an important part at least for me is that they are 2 separate entities, the vtuber and the irl person, while idol culture is toxic in itself, the way that people these people behave is disgusting and sickening!!!! 

What if the irl model have, you know a real life! We came to love and watch Rushia, being a vtuber is her job! Why peopla cannot accept that!??? Be Rushia is her job, out of that she is a real person with a real life!!!!!! I don't know and don't care if she in real life is a married woman or something like that, because that is her own life! And she should be living it like any real person!!!!

Im mad because of those assholes we can lose something wonderful!!!!!";negative;;;;;

I don't know who these people are lol;neutral;;;;;
"I wonder what, if anything, Hololive will do in this case. I don't think she's done anything to violate Hololive's rules at all, despite the drama.

Hololive really ought to drop the idol thing and start making their male vtubers interact with their female vtubers. Might tick off some of the current fan base, but it's perhaps a bandage that needs to be ripped off.";neutral;;;;;

i hope this incident serves as a reminder";positive;;;;;
"Hololive: our idols can't date other people within the company 

Hololive simps: I mean they ARE idols it only makes sense!

their idols date someone irl

Hololive simps: these are real people behind these avatars, they should do whatever they want, how dare you expect them to be loyal to you!

"This whole situation is hilarious. These no life Rushia simps did honestly expect her to remain single for like 5 years?

She got like 3 Million bucks from those Simps. She should just admit it and be done with it. This japanese culture is a joke and every non japanese viewer is laughing about this obvious fact.";positive;;;;;

"I'm late to the whole thing, but from what I've read this just looks like a very predictable outcome of how a good number of Vtubers market themselves. If the industry as a whole doesn't wake up things like this are gonna keep happening or even keep getting worse.

I think the whole practice of marketing to vulnerable, lonely people to squeeze them of their money is scummy. Not like I really simpatize with them, but I gotta be honest.";negative;;;;;

"I know I'm late, but I just gotta point this out: if they were really living together! I don't know, communicating with someone you're living with on Discord for stuff like 'I'm coming home'ù is a bit odd. Wouldn't most people just use LINE or send a text? 

That being said, even if they were dating and just have that odd habit it really isn't the end of the world LOL";negative;;;;;

"How did the idol world end up with such shameless fans? It's beyond me how they have the 'courage' to make such embarrassing complaints. It seems idols always have to live dysfunctionally to sustain their ""availability"" fetish to these creepy losers. And then there's all this nonsense about idols being ""pure"", which incidentally means no relationships or sex... When did all these Puritan Christians rise from their graves? The sheer pity and contempt I hold towards such trash makes me nauseous. Too many of these savages haven't caught up to modern sensibilities on psychological welfare or sex positivity. 

But it's not easy to know who to blame. Is the idols' fault for generating such sickening followers? Or is it the fault of their followers for thinking their fanaticism isn't the humiliating character that it is?";negative;;;;;
"At this point, there are several times more people complaining about harrasment than there are people who are harassing.

You're an awesome mod. :);positive;;;;;
Unless there something substantive that can be discussed I think this is drama bait and you guys should reconsider.;positive;;;;;
"dramabait. hololive sub is shutting down this topic, mafumafu already tweet to defuse. not worth keep digging this up.

this is my report, and im going to double down on the defuse tweet part.

look at mafu's tweet. ""we aren't in a relationship.""

now look at the comments. ""getting burnt is expected for someone in a relationship doing GFE, and both them and their gachikois deserves it.""

See the difference in topic here? despite whatever he said the comment section is insistent on treating that as a lie first and foremost, then to not harass them or ""learn a lesson about parasocial relationship"", based on a what if statement.

get this discussion going when someone actually admits to being in a relationship while doing GFE/BFE experience sure, but as it is, under all this ""relevant talk"" is people outright refusing to accept anything other than ""mafumafu and rushia are going out and this is the just due they deserve. anyone saying anything else is bullshit including those two's.""

as it stands, this discussion will just keep going as if they're really dating even if the companies were to intervene. hell even drama stirrers are having a field trip. here's a link of someone livestreaming to milk this situation as if they really are dating, right in this thread : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBlDJTC09SU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBlDJTC09SU)

I just want others view whether or not this drama will surpass past drama in Hololive history..";negative;;;;;
What's the reason of mafumafu sending such message to rushia during the stream though? Maybe I'm missing something but I'm a bit confused at the situation due to that specific message started all this mess...;negative;;;;;

"just out these pairs in love hotels 

crisis averted";positive;;;;;
"Coming to think of it, this situation that happened to Rushia was worst upon worst and the timing, Jesus: 
1- It happened to her out of all other holomem, why her? well her niche in ''GFE'' aka ''Girlfriend Experience'' and the fans she attracted are mostly lonely guys that hooked on to this type of ''Gachikoi''. 
2- It happened near Valentine's day, the day that all of the Hololive fans waited for so long to experience the most ''Gachikoi'' moment and it went down worst. 
3- It happened during the sale of ''Engagement Ring'' merchandise the notorious merch that all ''Gachikoi'' fans of Hololive want their ''Oshi'' to sell them. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
Also it's noteworthy to say that not Cover, not mafumafu and not Rushia denied the dating thing: 
1-Cover said ""Don't stick your nose into people's private"", 
2-Rushia on her tweet repeatedly said ""sorry"", 
3-On the other hand mafumafu on his tweet said: 
-""ÂêÊ£≤Å™Å©ÅÆ∫ãÂÆüÅØÅîÅñÅÑÅæÅõÇì"" 
-""There is no fact such as cohabitation."" 
-but he could say: 
-""ÉáÉºÉÅ™Å©ÅÆ∫ãÂÆüÅØÅÇÇäÅæÅõÇì"" or ""∫§ÈöõÇÑÂêÊ£≤Å™Å©ÅÆ∫ãÂÆüÅØÅÇÇäÅæÅõÇì"" 
-""There is no fact such as dating."" or ""There are no facts such as dating or cohabitation"" 
Which personally makes me believe they're dating but they're not living together due to his voice can be heard from Rushia's stream, but maybe this word ""ÂêÊ£≤"" is just a Japanese word for dating as well. 
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
All and all this happened to the worst person for this case at the bad timing of the year (imagine if this happened around her anniversary) and the odds are against her as we speak !or maybe something happening in behind the scenes that everything seems to be accidental but a mastermind is behind this all muwhahahahah!

As a fan of both Russia and mfmf I never really met any fans so I never knew this ≠ I'm also a kpop fan tho and ik how the community is and im genuinely so sorry a lot of us are like this;negative;;;;;
Man this just makes sad, I'm a long time mafumafu fan and I'm neutral to rushia but the fact that the JP fanbase gets mad at something that might not be what the thought aka misunderstanding and the fact that they really like getting into their idols personal life is just sad..i think they need a big lawn and some trees, go outside with facemasks on and enjoy a bit of nature.;negative;;;;;
So you're telling me their fan groups are probably going to kill each like the extended families of a married couple that oppose the marriage? Hopefully the most toxic members of each fan base tire each other out with pointless bickering while the rest wake up and realize that the odds of them dating their fav idols were incredibly low to begin with.;positive;;;;;
My guy, hololive fans are some of the most creepy and obsessed virgins/stans you'll meet. They'll call people 'antis'ù and say they're not real fans when one of them does creepy weird shit (reality check, a lot of them are creepy and obsessed);positive;;;;;
"ùUnscathed'ù is a damn impossible request.

'ùLess harmed'ù is honestly the best we can wish for.

And anyway, being harmed on the 'ùlosing money'ù side isn't a problem. It's more or less just what one would expect as a matter of cause and consequence. She's kinda just reaping what she sowed.

"Surprisingly, I think there's some strange security in having a ship like Noel and Flare does. It's kinda clear when they drift apart from that dynamic (like Kiara and Calli) but due to the already established image of a relationship outside of the viewer's parasocial one, I feel like there's less a reaction when they do have an actual relationship of some sort.

Though of course, just simply not doing GFE content would probably help lessen that problem already.";negative;;;;;
I don't even think there's a problem with doing GFE content as long they make it clear that it's all just an act and address the parasocial relationships of their fans.;negative;;;;;
"I think of vtubers who do the GFE as going to a maid cafe, they provide a similar kind of service, that doesn't give you the rights to the ""performer"", they go on to their own lives you go to yours afterwards.

I understand the feeling of being betrayed, but unfortunately people don't know how to manage their feelings, especially the kind of people who are lonely and only in their head, this is how you make antis.";negative;;;;;
"I absolutely agree with point number one and think it's inexcusable the shit that is happening over this. Regardless of whether the relationship is real or not, no one should act the way some of these ""fans"" are.

But I have been thinking a good deal about point number 2. You are correct that there is a very real risk in the type of content she was creating, but from a purely business/pragmatic standpoint it was also very clearly successful. She is the number 1 superchatted individual in the world after all. And I think most will agree that while the girlfriend angle she often went with might not be the best, she never took it to a predatory degree.

But I think there is some worth in contrasting her with the second highest superchatted individual, Coco. Coco took nearly the exact opposite approach as Rushia. She largely poked fun at the idol culture. She occassionally played into it straight for superb gap-moe, but most of the time she was riffing on it. Her fans make fun of her and refuse to call her gachikoi most of the time. And under the persona she streams as now she interacts with men with zero backlash. But what's most interesting is her superchat statistics. Of all the girls in hololive Coco had the lowest average superchat value despite for much of her tenure holding the highest total superchat value. She had a lot of people donating small amounts, rather than the smaller group of high spenders that Rushia has.

I don't blame Rushia for the tactics she took. She played to her strengths and it obviously payed off. But I hope Cover looks at this incident, regardless of the truth behind it, and takes it upon themselves to discourage the girlfriend/gachikoi culture that leads to toxic shit like this. Maybe use this opportunity when shit is already hitting the fan to increase interactions between Hololive and Holostars. Normalize interactions between these girls and men, make it easier for them to talk about male friends in their lives like they do female ones. Maybe someday they will even mention actual relationships and not be torn apart like this. It won't happen overnight, but playing into the culture like Hololive does only encourages shit like this. None of that excuses the people doing it though.";negative;;;;;
Exactly;positive;;;;;
"Have been following this for a while now, since the streams actually happened and were archived, and I agree with you.
'ã
The entire thing is fucked up. Managements for these GFE/BFE Vtubers/singers are fucking up by not discouraging this gachikoi behaviour that the vtubers themselves enforce by their streams and/or their merch.
Hating on the gachikois and the fandeads who bought into these things is fucked up, and it becomes clear when you see Japan's depression and mental health statistics- of course such marketing ploys to attack mentally unwell people will garner diehard fans who will spend tens of thousands to feel less lonely, and of course those fans will get mad when something like this is unveiled. The least, but still a non-negligible portion of the blame lies on the persons in question themselves, MafuMafu and Rushia, largely for knowingly (or unknowingly, in some cases) baiting in fans and giving them the GFE/BFE content. Also point 2 from your comment.
Equally shit here are so called antis and Twitter white knights. The antis fuelling the fire by trolling or throwing around the c word, and the white knights for blindly accusing Gachikois and possibly mentally unfit people who spent tens of thousands of dollars on a VTuber, and villifying these gachikoi fans like its their fault for grabbing an easy escape. If anything, it is a part of the JP idol industry (or the kpop industry in case of kpop stans), and as westerners who have little idea of how it goes, and little investment in their careers, we should just shut the hell up and let JP media and the involved agencies handle it, instead of dealing out judgements on twitter.
It is not the fandeads' fault, neither it is Rushia or mfmf's, its the management's fault for promoting these things for economic gain, and it is our fault for still supporting these organizations over indie vtubers.
Edit: changing the first paragraph.
it implies that management is outright forcing them to do it, which is dumb whichever way you look at it.
also omitting the second, because it relied on the first.";negative;;;;;

It really impacted her popularity, but she recovered.";negative;;;;;
Who is Lucia?;positive;;;;;
"It would still be a big deal. Like it was to Matsuri.

But not NEARLY as big.

The Matsuri case was pretty bad for a week, but then it died and everything was OK. This is more or less what would happen with almost damn near every other talent.

Also because Matsuri's case was much more ambiguous and the probability of an actual boyfriend behind the cause is honestly just pretty low. Also because Matsuri has a history of being quite open about her personal life.

Rushia, however!

She's very literally the single worst one to be caught doing this.";negative;;;;;

"Well, we don't know the actual real guidelines that they have setup. For all we know, they might have them, and try to enforce them but the members themselves might not be respecting them 100% of the time. It happens all the time, even in big companies. There are all these courses about privacy, data security, not using personal accounts at work, etc., and still, there are people that circumvent these measures because they are just inconvenient/uncomfortable. Or the member can also relax on applying the rules and accidents like this happen. 

For example, months ago, Yagoo actually told Rushia to stop using Facebook and she complied. We have seen how managers have bonked them even midstream. So there are guidelines in there, we just don't know the full extent of them.

Besides guidelines, another possible issue is privacy and security education. This is the biggest issue in big companies regardless of the rules. Enforcement of guidelines don't matter if folks don't have a mentality about protecting themselves in a work environment. If they haven't done that already, they can try to reinforce these with specific courses about data privacy and security in a work environment.";negative;;;;;
"I honestly thought they had some guidelines set up already to prevent random non-work related messages from popping up midstream, but this incident kinda shows it just never happened until...well, it did.

The perspective everyone is ignoring is the fact that this is her job and the blowback from this directly affects her income as the top superchat grossing vtuber in the world.

"Agreed. However, it's like almost everyone is talking about the ""crazy fanbase"", rather than the actions of Rushia. Is this the halo effect in action? Rushia intentionally sold the GFE experience, and then regular people get angry at the mentally unstable people who were swindled? It's absurd.

Personally i think the part that should be Blame in this incident is rushia careless action of letting private message goes public wich affect he job as a streamer";negative;;;;;
"Agree with all things you said, except the last line.
So some degree of blame lies with her for not taking proper precautions and cultivating a very parasocial audience, but most of the blame lies with the fans freaking out, who can't figure out that a streamer isn't their gf.
I don't know how you claim the following but then arrive to the above conclusion.
Some amount of unadjusted people who can't tell the difference is inevitable as a streamer, but the streamer can definitely affect the percentage of their audience who are like that.
I completely agree with this first point you made. There will always be neurotic/unadjusted people who struggle with mental issues. Rushia KNOWINGLY sells the GFE to garner a loyal fanbase and popularity (this is nothing new in the game, i.e. something similar would be like selling an e-girl's sexuality/cleavage to garner popularity of a young male fanbase), which gathers more of those with mental issues or grows those mental issues amongst some people (the latter, knowingly or not). Rushia is obligated to like whoever she wants. If she didn't sell the GFE, there would still be people who would be angry, albeit much less.
This is quite a crude example, but I think upholds the core argument: The majority of people who play the lottery consistently are generally poor, not very intelligent, or ignorant. Suppose the government needs to fund it's new politicians, but doesn't have enough tax payer money. These new politicians work hard, and are inclined to a paycheck for running the country. The government sets up a lottery with a big jackpot. However, consider if the government secretly never has a jackpot, and the scheme is to make money (this is practically true), so they tell everyone to buy, and tell everyone that they can strike it rich! Normal people understand that the lottery is realistically a hoax. The government understands that as well, and targets the class of people who would buy these tickets. They tell them, think about buying whatever car or house they want if they win! However, a whistleblower leaks this information, and all the people who have been buying lottery tickets for years, find out there was never a way for them to win. The people are very, very angry, and they riot. There would be much less angry people if they didn't specifically advertise lottery tickets (since less people would buy them), and if they just briefly mentioned they had options such as bonds, lottery tickets, stocks, etc.
You're claiming the majority of the fault lies within the generally poor, ignorant, or dim-witted people? I think it's the other way around. I think the government is the majority at fault for instigating this sort of elevated outcome. Elevated as in, specifically targeting a specific demographic that then became a larger population who are likely to be angry that they didn't know.

I think the problem is twofold, as another commenter said. People should not be so crazy about this, but also GFE content brings this kind of fanbase, usually comprised of mentally unwell people.

"Separating fiction and reality'ù is a weak argument. No it's not. If you can't figure out the basic premise that public figures that you look up to/like have private lives and may have disclosed information about themselves that is different from reality and might be misleading, you need help; a reality-check if you will. This goes not just for vtubers, but any public figure. The same thing happens to western celebrities. How is it possible for people to not realize that public figures at best care about their fans to an extent that a single human is able to care about millions of people - perhaps an appreciation and love of the fanbase as a whole, but certainly not on a personal level.
What would truly be surprising to find out isn't the reality that one of them might have a boyfriend, but rather if the reality was that most of them DON'T have boyfriends. They all seem like nice people, they are pretty irl from what I have seen from the random YT recommendations and I would assume most of them live...well relatively normal lives. So...why exactly would you expect them to not have an SO? An assumption like that logically does not follow in my mind.
I have been watching vtubers since Kizuna Ai debuted. I have watched online streams since JustinTV. I have watched youtube since mid 2000s. I have literally never felt this level of obsession nor do I understand how people are naturally unable to understand the reality.
Like do people really think that just because she streams and has a big male fanbase, she has committed her life to basically be a nun? Like really? REALLY? Have their delusions really taken them so far that they think she has dedicated her personal life to people whom she will never meet?
Cassinos are illegal in many countries for a reason.
You don't lose money watching people online. You also don't get blacklisted for counting cards in Blackjack. Casinos literally kick you out if they think you are doing something to win consistently. That's why counting cards is considered ""cheating"".
ending a message in public space and expecting no one to see? Bro, what the fuck?
So I do agree with this. He should have known that sending a message like this is going to set off irrational fans. He should have ensured that it's done through a more private channel. Definite misplay, but to the extent of protecting himself/Rushia. They may not have handled it well and could have avoided the situation altogether, it does not justify the reaction of either of the irrational portion of their fanbase.
it's honestly just sad. I can't even blame them. They are just broken people 'ùrightfully'ù angry to finally realise that
It's sad, but you can absolutely blame them for their behaviour. They need to take a break from their oshi.
their Gacha game was just a scam all along.
There is no RNG here. Unless you are trying to roll and hope that you randomly get selected as the one special fan by the person you are watching. In that case...I don't know what to say.

It's her fault for acting like a terrible person. But it's also your fault for falling for her completely legal business.

Not saying she IS a terrible person by any means. I'm pretty sure she didn't have any ill intent and actually enjoyed what she was doing. I doubt it was SOLELY for profit. But still, this is what she did. She played with fire and burned herself.

Apparently, their fans and gachis who they duped by pushing a serious kind of relationship and selling them engagement rings.;neutral;;;;;
"But while we're on the subject of ""Love"" can I go off on a tangent since we're just talking about it?

Love is such a fragile and fickle thing. There's so many aspects about it if you really think about it. Some people just call it an emotion and there's not much to think about, but there really is a lot more than just chemistry.

first of all, Love =/= attraction. You can be attracted to the person you love, but attraction doesn't necessarily mean you love a person. There's diminishing returns when it comes to being attracted to someone. The chemicals in your brains that used to go off like fireworks diminish to just party poppers over time. If you see a couple that last longer that 2 - 7 years they've built up something past just attraction and there's something else that keeps them together.

And there there's the fact that people change over time. Like a lot of people like to lump together the qualities they want for themselves and then look for those qualities on a different person without trying to separate ""these are the qualities that I want for myself"" and ""these are the qualities that I want in a partner"". Like someone will want to learn english and then suddenly a person who can speak english extremely well will appear and that person will look really attractive all of a suddent to people who cant differenciate that. Or for some people who are a bit older will start to find younger people a lot more attractive than they used to because they're attracted to ""youth"". But say that the person who wanted to learn english gets extremely good at english and they liked the other person who was good at english, just because of the fact that they were good at english, are they going to still like that person now that their initial needs are met?

And there's also problem with timing becauses some people aren't just looking for relationships at that moment. Like back in college I had a friend in one of my classes who I used to sit next to and hang out with. She was extremely pretty, had eyes like a cool summer sky, had a voice like a song bird and sang like one too, was gentle, kind, and intelligent. I was attracted to her and she threw hints at me that the feeling was mutual. She ended up kind of sitting me down and strongly hinted ""Hey, I'm kind of want to get in a relationship"" and I gently pushed her away (not physically). I was extremely attracted to her but I just wasn't looking for any kind of romantic commitments at the time because I was an extreme mess at the time and I couldn't be there emotionally for her since I was so preoccupied with my own baggage.

Then there's the social pressure from others like parents wanting their children to marry or something just because it's the social norms or they want to demand certain requirements for their suitors or whatever the fuck people want to shame people about these days, blah blah blah.

Like there's so much shit that can go wrong when it comes to relationships, if people decide that they want to live in the moment, just let them have their small piece of happiness even if it's for a little bit.";negative;;;;;
Virtually no one outside of Japan watches Japanese vtubers. Just look at channel metrics. Not even 10% of Pekora's viewers are from the US. For smaller channels and ones where it's mostly zatsudan, like Ayame's, it's easily less than 3%. Of course no one will pay attention to Japanese vtuber meta drama.;negative;;;;;
It's both, but it's not like Hololive requires the girls to play up GFE. Some do, some don't. Therefore the blame is mostly on the girls who do if/when they get found out.;negative;;;;;

"It's naive to think teenagers and young adults won't fall in love and date just because they are idols. Some may give up on being in a relationship, but a good number of them will date someone at some point. The mentality is pretty much ""as long as you don't get caught, you should be fine"".

Also, IN MY OPINION I highly doubt that all 40+ women never had any relationships while being part of holo. They may not talk about it, which is understandable, but that doesn't mean they don't date.";negative;;;;;
Well I mean, that may be Japanese idol culture, but this is just a vtuber/streamer company. Who knows the contract they sign, but I would assume they're allowed to have a normal life outside of vtubing.;negative;;;;;
I think it has to do with the type of audience that is attracted to her content. Mentally sound folks like you and many of us commenting here are obviously okay to the overall issue. However, i cant say the same to those who have fallen very deep into a parasocial relationship with her;negative;;;;;
Idk, it's not that hard to believe that the world has people who are lonely, desperate and unhinged, especially when it comes to fans of certain media. Rushia takes the GFE way beyond most vTubers for an audience of her size and she should be well aware the kinds of people she will attract. Not faulting her decisions but there's a reason she's one of the most superchatted persons out there and it does rely on taking advantage of some of those kinds of people who have a warped reality.;negative;;;;;

"The best part to me is some of the stuff that can be considered the same might be because they have mutual friends who give out gifts they known their friends would like.

To use hololive for example, Sora gave out Godiva chocolate to several members (probably most/all of the ones living in Japan, likely including certain former members like Coco) so right now EVERY hololive member likely has a little plastic container of godiva chocolates somewhere in their room.

Now, let's use a hypothetical and say mfmf also knows Sora (unlikely but...well, yeah) and received one of the packages of godiva chocolate (or one of the girls who knows Rushia and mfmf regifted it...the details aren't really the point) and had it in his room.

A normal person aware of the fact that Sora sent out chocolates to everyone she knew would deduce that he knows Sora.

A crazy person would deduce that he's dating Sora. (which is patently ridiculous on even more levels if you know about the valentine's day tradition in Japan) or that Rushia regifted it to him.

An even crazier person would deduce that he's cheating on Rushia with Sora.

And it goes on from there.";positive;;;;;
I think 'sometimes'ù is an understatement;positive;;;;;
I think you are a bit naive about what many people think of women in same-sex relationships and why it's 'acceptable'ù compared to this situation with Rushia. Especially in Japan. They're seen by many as immature dalliances, not 'actual'ù relationships.;negative;;;;;
And yet the entire BS with Mori still happened recently.;neutral;;;;;
"Indeed, any reasonable and well-adjusted person should realize that their GFE provider will have a personal life, and that it's delusional to expect them to remain single and virgin just for them.

Then again, reasonable and well-adjusted people don't really spend big bucks on GFE.";positive;;;;;
Unfortunately not all the fans have the mental maturity to know it wasn't real from the start.;negative;;;;;
"Any sane person wouldn't need such a disclaimer, and those that do won't listen to said disclaimer

Theres no way to win once u start doing GFE, you are bound to attract such fans and play a dangerous balancing game with them for their donations";positive;;;;;
"Well the thing is a lot of these idol/vtubers seems to consciously blur the line between being real and virtual. And that they aren't being transparent in the first place nor do they actively discourage (at least not to my knowledge, I could be wrong) these kinds of toxic relationship. 

These contents' target audience are mentally unhealthy people. I almost feel like that is their business model. 

Just like many have pointed out, anyone with a healthy social relationship will not spend big bucks on these types on content. Unless they are super rich, that is. Normal people will likely spent the majority of their excess money for family, or spend money on personal development, or rent and shit. Those with unhealthy social life (or borderline mentally ill) spend less because they don't look after themselves (self-negligence), nor do they spent on other people (I.e. on family or on social gatherings). So you have a bunch of lonely and unhealthy people with money sitting around. These people who craves personal intimacy and attention then got told that a cute girl on the internet 'loves and cares about you'ù. She shares things about her personal life and emotions with you. She reads your superchat, stalk your Twitter and remember your name ~~YouTube Username~~. It's probably more 'love'ù they have received than from anyone else for the past couple years. That is a portion of the people who scrap the bottom of the barrels to donate a super-chat. And these people are the ones that converted to actual gachikoi and get toxic when the unicorn illusion is broken.

If your business model is build upon, in a sense, exploiting mentally unhealthy people. I feel like the livers should take a certain degree of personal responsibility in reminding them that this is unhealthy and is purely illusions.

Everything I see the gachikois I think of this [Deron clips](https://youtu.be/HohfmA3Hs3I) where she discourage gachikois, or the fact that tamaki's mama announced her marriage. It's very much about the content you create and the fan base you cultivate.";positive;;;;;
"Those things ARE clear to any mentally healthy person, especially in Rushia's case where she often plays into a yandere character for entertainment and it should be obvious for everyone that it's a bit.

As for those mentally-unwell people, I was always of the opinion that a person's mental health is their own responsibility, and it's dumb to try and blame others for unpredictable and delusional actions of people who neglected their mental health.";positive;;;;;
I'd say such content is manipulative at its core. If it makes up a big part of your streaming then I'm not convinced any level of disclaimer is enough.;neutral;;;;;
"[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLBNO33bMX0) exists IRL already, all with strict guidelines attached, so its virtual version should've been easier to handle. Unfortunately it's also easier to be stupid idiots online than in person lol

"it obviously paid off. But
FTFY.
Although payed exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:
Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. The deck is yet to be payed.
In payed out when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. The rope is payed out! You can pull now.
Unfortunately I was unable to find nautical or rope related words in your comment.
Beep, boop, I'm a bot";negative;;;;;
"I think there's a bit of a disconnect here, but I will admit I don't know the entire story behind the scenes. Hololive for the most part does not seem to force this kind of content on Rushia or any of the girls, the GFE content is likely her idea. However, I will concede that marketing does have some blame given the content of her birthday merch, but I will also bring up that more likely than not, the girls have some say in what merch they wish to sell or not sell. There are clips of the girls being asked if certain merch was OK or not, iirc. I won't say I blame Rushia entirely, but I think its a bit... disingenuous? to say that Rushia is not at some level of fault.

Mafumafu, I know very little about, so I won't go into that. But I do also think the blame lies partially on these people not finding help, and to a greater extent, Japan's or rather most of Asia's culture that sorta kinda makes these mentally unstable people not get help. Sure, a mentally unstable person is not entirely in control of their actions, but it does not absolve them of their actions entirely and in some cases they face a form of punishment one way or another.

EDIT: last bit to be more in line with my opinion, rather than stating something that could be factually incorrect due to my limited understanding of the law";negative;;;;;
"the white knights for blindly accusing Gachikois and possibly mentally unfit people who spent tens of thousands of dollars on a VTuber, and villifying these gachikoi fans like its their fault for grabbing an easy escape

""Mental illness is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.""

I think that quote is apt here.

Plus, it's also the responsibility of streamers facilitating these parasocial relationships to not encourage people to continue doing unhealthy things. Look at how Subaru loves her viewers, but also draws clear boundaries and tries to pull people back from the brink when she sees superchats that worry her.";negative;;;;;
"The part about management stopping this is a very nuanced topic, because the debate on how much management should interfere with the content is always pretty heated 

Coco for instance cited wanting more content freedom as one of the reasons she graduated 

And it's pretty clear that most in hololive enjoy having more autonomy in terms of their content 

Considering which talents lean heavily into GFE content and which don't lean much into it, I imagine some talents enjoy doing that content, and it's arguable that if they enjoy it and want to do it, it's not management's right to stop that";positive;;;;;
It's wanting to have your cake and eat it too. You want the attention of a dedicated and emotionally attached fanbase but don't want to deal with the fallout from when they turn on you. I think a lot of the responsibility goes around really, we don't know if management is the one who pushed her into that type of content. There are other members from Hololive that don't lean into it at all and they don't seem to be pressured to do so and the official stuff from Hololive is usually pretty light on how they portray each talent, it's usually the talents themselves who develop their characters. A lot of the heavy GFE seems to happen on members only streams too, which is a pretty big optical yikes when something like this happens.;negative;;;;;
"The least, but still a non-negligible portion of the blame lies on the persons in question themselves, MafuMafu and Rushia, largely for knowingly (or unknowingly, in some cases) baiting in fans and giving them the GFE/BFE content.
That's pure victim blaming. You can't seriously expect them to account for a few dozen unpredictable mentally ill people, when everyone else is quite aware that they're entertainers doing character bits. It's not their responsibility.
It is not the fandeads' fault, neither it is Rushia or mfmf's, its the management's fault for promoting these things for economic gain, and it is our fault for still supporting these organizations over indie vtubers.
The Hololive management doesn't dictate the talent's content (or their merch), they only allow/disallow, or in rare cases, make suggestions. If you're gonna spout anti-corporate crap at least know what you're talking about.";negative;;;;;
How exactly? Does subscribers give you mindcontrol powers to forcefully stop human stupidity? Teach me your magics great sage.;positive;;;;;
I don't disagree, them being not well adjusted is not a point of contention. But the world has a lot of lonely desperate people and those people are also easily baited by that type of content to spend their time and money for you, especially when you play into it often. Until they turn on you of course. That's the whole point. It's stupid to pretend otherwise especially if you've got experience having an online presence.;negative;;;;;
It's not a question of what should happen, it's a question of what will happen. Nobody is questioning the shittiness of what happened. I'm pretty sure my first point already covered what you said, that's exactly why I made that caveat because I knew there would be people who would only look at the problem in terms of an ideal world. If we really cared about solving the problem, complaining about what should be isn't going to solve anything. The socio-cultural reality of the internet, and this is especially true in Japan, is that there are a lot of lonely mentally unwell young people who cannot engage with certain types of content in a healthy manner. When you capitalize on this you necessarily feed into the toxic cycle, intentionally or not, and will have to face the risk that comes with it. Berating a bunch of mentally unwell people online isn't going to do anything, especially not when it's a problem that's been growing for decades. We have to take a holistic approach at looking at the problem if we truly want to understand and minimize harm wether or not we think it's fair or deserved.;negative;;;;;
"She once explained that the door behind her opened while she was streaming, not as Matsuri, but as a previous life (another active one), and that it was a suspicious person, not a family member. However, she once told me that she continued streaming for a while afterwards as if nothing had happened, and then the police responded.
Of course, it's impossible for a suspicious person to enter a house, and many people had questions about that, and she later changed her Twitter icon to a picture of her holding up her middle finger, which caused a lot of animosity from some gachikoi and fans.
Many people have left Matsuri because of this, and tend to be disliked by hako-oshi.";negative;;;;;
Because, unfortunately, leaning into GFE means you're basically relying on money from a lot of very mentally unwell people.;neutral;;;;;
Bcs Rushia fostered such gachikoi fanbase and basically encouraged parasocial relationships by providing needy girlfriend experience.;positive;;;;;
Unfortunately, that's how the idol culture is over there. That's why some idol singers are prohibited from dating as stated in their contract. It is ridiculous.;negative;;;;;
When you purposefully try to market to the crazies, you end up with the crazies;positive;;;;;
Because let's be honest these people don't care about how well they can play fucking Mario kart. They have anime attractive girls with the perfect physical features to attract lonely virgins. Hololive literally caters to this crowd.;negative;;;;;
"This is largely due to the increase in new viewers who don't know what it was like back then.
It is true that for a while there was a larger percentage of English-speaking viewers, and the impact was significant.
Furthermore, in this case, Rushia and MuffMuff were allegedly involved in the last fiasco, but this time, their messages were seen in the streaming, so the impact on SuperChat will probably be huge, considering that the top payers of SuperChat (Gachikoi) are taking this one very seriously.
Furthermore, the fact that Mafumafu is a popular singer who competed in Kohaku, and there were many articles about her in Yahoo Japan and other media, will also have a big impact.
I think it is inevitable that they will either disappear from the SuperChat rankings or drop down the rankings.";negative;;;;;
"She's literally the single worst one to be caught doing this.

and having this drama on the same week as valentine day. and having this just a little before people start receving the Rushia ""eternal love"" engagement ring that was for sale.

the worst person AND probable the worst week to ever had this type of drama.";negative;;;;;
"Lmao people are still coping about the matsuri case bringing out all the excuses as to why she couldn't possibly have a SO.

1. She was never scared when chat was saying someone was in her house.
2. She lied about someone breaking into her house because she wasn't scared in the vid and proceeded to keep streaming anyways

She would never admit personally to dating a guy irl, girls are fine because people think it's hot and not serious whereas someone of the opposite sex would break their fantasy";negative;;;;;
"This is potentially an ""I'm gonna end this person's whole career"" scenario. Like, all her gfe content is done for from this point onwards. The upcoming Valentine's programme is absolutely out the window, the bride acrylic stand and engagement ring merch are now laughing stock (from what I gathered from japanese comments and tweets), any ""gachikoi"" listening to her asmr will basically turn into that rent-a-girlfriend meme (you know which one I'm talking about), and people most certainly will remind her about this slip-up whenever she attempts any GF roleplay. Her biggest selling point as a vtuber is ruined to the core.

I'm surprised Rushia manage to stay GFE very long;neutral;;;;;
I hate to say but it is true.I do not justify anti behaviour by any means, nor I think vtubers should be denied private lives at all. But it's true Rushia not only plays along with parasocial fans, but often encourages the behaviour explicitly in some of her content.;negative;;;;;

"likewise, i think looking at a content creator who you never met as a girlfriend is pretty idiotic.

if anything, it's because there are people who want that kind of content that there are creators who provide it.

and in the end, who's scummy? The one that provide a girlfriend experience to those that wants it, or the people who asked for it, got it, then got mad that the creator isn't actually their GF?

"Nothing against KoreKore, a man has to make a living, but his channel feeds off of drama like this, so it's hard to imagine that he's doing everything in good faith. Not to dig up old wounds, but he for example definitely threw fuel on the flames back in 2020 during the whole situation with Coco, as in the case of a [clip like this one](https://m.imgur.com/IoWT98G) during a livestream.

I can see maybe someone trying to argue that he's speaking for his 'friends'ù since they can't speak for themselves due to the sensitive nature of it all, but with his history I'm fairly skeptical. Seems to me like he knows what he can get away with saying without it coming back to burn him, and the rabid fans are just desperate to get any scrap of info.";negative;;;;;

Don't worry she will definitely have support from cover. If cover stayed out of this they wouldn't only be sacrificing one of their most profitable talents but their reputation as a company itself would plummet by leaving their idols to fend for themselves. Plus the hololive members themselves would prob give emotional support to her irl? idk just speculation from their interactions which might just be fake for entertainment.;neutral;;;;;
Maybe management stopped her posting response because she is in unstable condition. . And can make it worse. So i think cover will come out and helping her to form a good wording without hurting anyone or gives a negative impact to others that involved. She is just a girl after all. Not like I'm underestimate girl, but girls tend to unstable when this kind of things came up;negative;;;;;
Not worth, nor necessary. She would make enough for a living anyways;neutral;;;;;

But at the same time you see this GFE bullshit happening and Hololive as a company 100% promoting and profiting off these lonely fucks and when it's working we praise the supachat numbers and the community engagement and when its not working we say ""Man we gotta do something about all these lonely creeps screwing up my idols"" Bro they are literally the ones paying the bills.";negative;;;;;

Why would she delete her Line account frequently?;neutral;;;;;
"discord by nature is for personal/casual use. the fact that hololive is using the entire thing for all private company stuff is a red flag in itself. alternatives like slack or microsoft teams that are targeted at companies have features like data auditing and protection, login via corporate accounts among others.

members using their ""corporate"" accounts for personal use is just the tip of the iceberg. if discord itself or holo staff admin discord account is compromised, all of holo's internal business dealings could be made public and liability would not be on discord.";negative;;;;;

To be honest I think she is popular enough and being part of Holo should would still be really popular even w/o the GFE. Maybe less SC earnings;negative;;;;;
That's never going to happen.;neutral;;;;;
That is my point, that is a setting in discord which is off by default. She should have turned on streamer mode manually, to be fair I can see why someone would keep the setting off cause if they don't close OBS then discord would basically be always muted whenever OBS is open which can end up with you missing lots of messages/calls or whatever you use discord for;negative;;;;;
Yep. Each time I open OBS, even if it's to tweak some settings or add some new graphic to a scene or something, Discord goes full streamer mode. I had instances of completely missing messages by my friends because I just alt-tabbed out of OBS instead of closing it, and it kept Discord completely silent;negative;;;;;
"I don't know how managers work in Hololive but they're definitely hit or miss, the amount of times members don't end stream or forget to mute at the end and something, usually completely harmless but still, leaks is crazy.
I get sometimes its just manufactured because its cute and endearing but they can't all be that.
Where are the managers? Do they even watch the streams and do they have a way to immediately contact the streamer in case of oopsies?";negative;;;;;
"She is obviously doing it for money but at the same time, let's hope she wasn't that naive to not expect this kind of drama after appealing to a big group of people incapable of separating IRL stuff from the anime avatar.

Having your world suddenly gone hostile will freak everyone no matter who they are. My cynic side tell me that tweet is just over exaggeration. But If that tweet happen a week from now on then that is when I'm really worried. In the end we can only just hope for the best.;negative;;;;;
I feel like people in this sub mostly find that rushia at least share some responsibility in the situation.;negative;;;;;
"Agreed, this is just Rushia's business model, with Hololive/Cover assisting.

They want this crazy fanbase because they can extract money from them.";negative;;;;;
"Yeah, it's crazy that no one is upset about Rushia's actions. She sold the 'GFE,' she should've known better than to have a boyfriend. Next we might find out she's not actually a necromancer and can't actually raise the dead! God forbid! And next you'll tell me that the reason the waitress was nice to me wasn't because she was into me! Or that Robert Downey Jr. isn't actually Ironman!
Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? She's playing a character. You're defending people for being toxic because it was revealed that Rushia was playing a character, a fact people should have known from the beginning. The people who bought it as reality are the problem, completely. Or, what, did you think that the maid at the maid caf© is actually your personal maid? No. People come for the experience, pay for the service of pretending that Rushia is a crazy possessive girlfriend, but anyone who's actually sane knows that's not the case. There's literally thousands of people buying her 'engagement ring,' should those people have assumed they were the only one? Or that she was only their girlfriend, not any of the other thousands of concurrent viewers?
You're saying the people in this thread defending her have 'rose tinted glasses' on, but the reality is they just do not care about Rushia's personal life. They like the character, and that's where it stops. The fact that you do care enough to blame these rabid fans' actions on her is telling of which side of the spectrum you lie on.
I don't even think it's the crazies that are the worst part of this fanbase, and why I don't tend to want to be associated with it. It's people who say shit like you just did, who think themselves 'neutral' but are willing to dismiss behaviors that are absolutely toxic and crazy in the scope of real life. Sure, feel bad for them all you like, it's a sad existence they lead, but don't even start trying to blame their craziness on the talent.";negative;;;;;
She's a woman trying to make a living for herself in a world where women are, apparently, still routinely denied agency and turned into commodity sexual objects for men. There is absolutely no sense in which she is in the wrong here.;negative;;;;;
The moment you become part of a harassment mob, you cease being a victim. Plenty of people have serious mental issues without weaponising them in aggregate with others, and it's clear that the blowback here is much more severe to the woman in question than the not-even-boyfriend.;negative;;;;;
"You have to wonder how many people who go apeshit over it actually do go apeshit for real, or it's the antis and the drama people and the memers who magnify the issue to make it seem more widespread than it actually is.

I mean I'm sure a lot of people went on a rant and cried about it, as expected of finding out their oshis are dating or getting married or whatever, then moved on after a day, but the memes about them keep going. I mean today for a whole day all I see on twitter is people talking about the gachikois laughing at them more than actual gachikoi meltdowns lmao. I'm not saying real, mentally sick people having full-blown self-destructive meltdowns don't exist, I'm saying maybe the counter-echo chamber about it amplify them to be more than the minority that they are, if that makes sense. (Of course, even a few people can be extremely dangerous and can pose a physical threat, and should not be taken lightly.)

Like Kanata ranted about Gakki getting married while [beating meat on stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZX2CR6b2Y) she was pretty much doing it half jokingly, and once she got everything out of her system she went back to normal immediately while other members and also her viewers tease her for it to this day, making her seem like an obsessive otaku. (tbf she has admitted that she is, but she also said she gets over it, and her oshi's happiness is her happiness, as she has proven with Gakki) I'm pretty sure most Japanese otaku who are not mentally gone are just like Kanata in how they handle these things. Go on a rant, get it out of their system, get over it, move on.

Edit: Added clip of Kanata beating meat";negative;;;;;
And as a hard-core fan of Marine even she has set boundaries to prevent this from occurring. Rushia is on a whole different level.;negative;;;;;

Kiara - aggressively gay

Mumei - cute psychopath, half the time I dunno what's happening on stream

Because there's more than enough brain dead simps that at least you'll get SOME viewers. With vtubing you remove the hassle of having to prove yourself because if you're anime levels of attractiveness then you get given the benefit of the doubt

"The better analogy would be that Rushia is similiar to a casino. They aren't forcing you to give them money but they are are enticing you to spend it and get sucked in to the experience.



Casino welcomes you into a flashy place that looks fun.

Rushia lures you in with a warm friendly girlfriend like experience.

User feels that the place may be fun, spends a little.

Casino ""Oh, you didn't win but maybe if you try again you could hit it big!""

Rushia ""Oh thank you for the donation, I love you, you very much""

User ""Maybe if I try again I can win big/maybe she will say more nice things to me (like a girlfriend)""

and then the user is so absorbed in to it they aren't aware of how deep they are sucked in.

And with gambling places, they really don't bother trying to stop you ""oh maybe you've gambled a bit too much"" but more like ""Here is a bonus!"" while Rushia doesn't actually try to prevent or stop hardcore parasocial relationships ""Remember guys, this is just for fun"" she just goes on with ""I love you so much!""";positive;;;;;

"This one is massively speculative.

Every source that indicates she had a boyfriend also indicates that she just had. And their break up didn't make for a nice time. It was really fucking bad!

Either she had a boyfriend and broke up.

Or they were actually just friends. Friends that either didn't work out or just decided to not talk anymore after a while.

We have no confirmation and it doesn't really matter, but yeah, Mumei's case indicates precisely the opposite. Most things indicate that she has a rough break up and was actually really affected by it.

The possibility of her having founding a new one still exists, of course.

But giving the timing / consequences of the previous one, it's a little unlikely. Given the fact that she is also fully devoting herself to work right now also makes things a little harder.

But well, not like she devotes herself to GF role-play anyways. And she is one of the few members that openly collabs with Stars like a chad!

Nene does it in a much goofier way than Rushia ever did. But she would definitely get more backlash than some members if she got found out.

Or maybe not since her channel is considerably smaller than Rushia's.

But still, Rushia was THE SINGLE WORST MEMBER that could get caught doing this.

This fact will also make this whole thing informative. Because no other member in the entirety of Hololive will have a backlash as great as hers. So at least we will kinda now just how far those issues can go when they reach the very limit.";negative;;;;;

Coco being similiar do to how she presented herself(And iirc her relativly big transparency about her personal life)



Rushia played VERY hard into e a certain subsection of Parasocial interactions.... namely the GFE, her content was the perfect breeding ground for any small thing(like this) to blow up in her face BECAUSE of the way her content is presented";negative;;;;;

1. These gachikoi were delusional to actually expect their provider of GFE/BFE roleplay to actually keep themselves ""pure"" IRL for them. The fans' behaviour is ultimately their own responsibility, and nobody deserves to be dogpiled like this for ""deceiving"" them.

2. Actively providing GFE/BFE content will only enable these kinds of gachikoi and you'd be a fool to believe otherwise. Also, both people involved knew this could happen, and could have taken much better precautions to prevent their relationship from being revealed.";negative;;;;;
"Even so, If as a viewer you feel entitled to something or special among more than a million subscribers you have a problem.

Her act is an act for entertainment. If you think a wink is a secret message to you alone or that she secretely wants you talk to you or that she needs your help in any way. You have a problem.

I can understand that it's complicated for a fan, even a soft fan, to support a girl that you know is going to spend that money going out with her boyfriend. But at that moment is when you must go to other places or turn the blind eye and say to yourself ""Yep, I like to keep joking around her breast size, the Eva screams and the Menhera attitude.

"There are absolutely steps that Cover could take to mitigate this.

Unfortunately, it is simply not in Cover Corp's interest to do any of this, since the gachikoi bring the big money.";negative;;;;;

That being said, why is it Rusia's, or any other streamers, responsibility to make sure their viewers don't fall into a parasocial relationship?

What makes vtubers different from irl celebrities? If anything, I'd say this current situation is worse, as it is for a fictional character (the line between a fictional character and real person is a bit blurred here, but that doesn't really matter in this scenario)

Rushia knows this stuff and enjoy its benefits, as we can see by the fact that she is the top SC on youtube and she knows that this is a bomb, there is a reason why when someone asked if she talked to holostars or something like that some months ago she went on about how she never talked to any of then, or see then or acknowledged that they were there, she went hard on it because she knows that anyone could trigger her fanbase and that was the downside of it.

No matter which name he drops, he could potentially damage her brand by doing so. if he says Rushia, he's drawing a connection between her and him, which is ""bad."" If he gives her other ID, then he's drawing a connection between her real ID, which is arguably worse.

I mean this is the same for men in gay relationships in fact it's more frowned upon in general compared to the female counterpart but it still stands that male vtubers will be shipped together especially by women because 1.

I wonder how true this is, or if it's just a meme from some peoples' intuitions that's assumed to be true, because from my perspective, the appeal of an oshi being a lesbian or in a homosexual relationship is that there's no guy to get jealous of.

Despite this obvious ""I'm just a character, I'm not really in love"" coding, she should still set her stance that she doesn't support gachikois. Like, she appreciates the support, but don't akasupa if you're expecting her to love you for it.

Maybe she could pull a Calli and just say that she won't respond to weirdo supas. Who knows. Either way, you changed my view a bit so ty";negative;;;;;
"I would say that everyone shares a degree of personal responsibility for this situation. Sure, mentally unfit people shouldn't consume these content. But I also highly doubt that these livers and the company did not know what they are doing. This sorta fan base is nothing new. They consciously sell these content, knowing that mentally unfit people will consume it and will pay with all the money they have. It is unethical to sell drugs of addictions (even if it's non-prescription) to support people's addiction. 

Not to mention that these white knighting simply empower companies to continue doing the same thing over and over again, at the expense of their talents mental health suffer.";negative;;;;;
"Love westerners trying to imply that this doesn't happen in the West right after Twitter was having a meltdown over Mitski touring with her favorite (male) popstar 

This happens everywhere. People encourage it all the time. It is up to the people buying into it to separate reality and fiction.";negative;;;;;
I don't think its the management that are doing it, and tbh out of current Holo lineups, only very few are as dedicated to that as Rushia. From management POV, its probably even better if she pivots away or don't do it so much since fallout from controversy like this will be their job to clean up. Its not like Hololive is lacking in contents or work that can be done lately, as seen from all the sponsor jobs, original song projects, official channel content, concert, etc.;negative;;;;;
"It doesn't help that Rushia is #1 in SC consistently on YouTube. It just gives ammo to her haters and hardcore fans from her and mafumafu, that she and Hololive(since they do profit of SC's as well) are intentionally and willingly HEAVILY profiting off fans with her GFE character. 

I'm curious how this will play out because an official apology from Rushia or Cover at this point I feel like is just admitting their is a relationship, and I'm assuming that is off the table. I'm guessing something along the lines of: 




""We are sorry that our talents were unprofessional and let their personal discord/social media come up while streaming blah blah, we are taking corrective action"". Rushia does 10 min apology video about something vaguely related to Discord while crying with just a png on the screen. Maybe takes a ""break"" because of stress. Fans from everywhere show their support during her absence. 20k upvoted post on r/hololive about how great Rushia is. She comes back to a 100k stream and lots of supas, and like clockwork things return to normal. 


I'm not trying to be sarcastic or anything. I don't know how this is supposed to work. I was around for the Towa thing and the thing with Matsuri's alt, but they all feel like pretty small-time compared to this since another famous male personality with a hardcore fan-base is involved. 


I am a fan of Rushia's. As an entertainer that is, so I obviously don't want to see anything seriously damaging happen to her. But, I'm split between wanting to see this just blow-over, and seeing something change whether it be how Rushia or Hololive does things.";negative;;;;;
Well for one, Not using the same Discord account you use as Rushia to talk to your non-work related friends? or maybe setting your discord's notification off? Basic OpSec? so no accident like this can happen?;positive;;;;;
"Insane people gonna insane... if it wasn't this it would be some cult BS or something else. She's selling a product that rational people can consume, enjoy, and have fun with. Insane people will be insane about it no matter what you make as your content.

Neither of them does BFE/GFE type streams and they still got the same level of insane hate from angry fans who felt betrayed that they were in an adult relationship with somebody.";positive;;;;;
"it's a question of what will happen.

The fact that we accept what ""will"" happen is part of the problem. People need to straight up condemn this shitty behavior when it happens as publicly as possible.

complaining about what should be isn't going to solve anything

Actually it's exactly what would solve the problem. If these people were called out and pointed at as actual problems and treated as the problems they are then the problem would be solved.

Berating a bunch of mentally unwell people online isn't going to do anything

Except this is exactly why this behavior isn't as much of a problem outside Japan: Western fans openly condemn this behavior while Japanese fans let it slide or even encourage it.

The ""It Can't Be Helped"" mentality is one of Japan's biggest problems and it's what allows people to get away with this shit. I see it a lot here in Japan: Someone takes advantage of the fact that people won't bother confronting them to get away with shit. It's even why kanchou is still a thing.";negative;;;;;
"Thanks for the info. While the way she handled it isn't particularly surprising from what I've seen of her, I wouldn't have expected Matsuri also get so badly by something like this since she seems like 1 of the less idol-like among the Hololive girls.

Maybe I'm just ignorant and in a way better metal place than I think I am, but I'm having a very hard time believing anyone who bought one of those rings views them as anything other than neat merch.

It's not because she's a girl, but she herself in a very compromised state.

"She hasn't earned enough to live the rest of her life without working, not even close

If you're 30 with $2 million, that's only $33,000 a year until you turn 90.

She's made $3.5 million, and kept $875,000 (25%) of it. Then you have to subtract taxes (10%) and you're left with $787,500

Assuming her living expenses are $60,000 a year (living expenses are 10% higher in Japan than USA) and she has to spend $10,000 a year on new equipment, traveling, buying games and software, etc, we can multiply the total ($70,000) by the time she has been streaming (2.5 years) which is $175,000.

Subtracted from the total, we can assume she has about $600,000. Rushia is 33, so if she lives to 84 (Japanese life expectancy) on only that money, she will have only $11,764 a year.

Walmart entry level jobs pay close to 3 times as much as that in the USA and the cost of living here is 10% less";negative;;;;;

Maybe you're right, and that I'm being biased by the fact that the most extreme comments are the loudest - I guess that's just how drama is. Though from quick glance I don't see many people putting majority of the blame on Rushia. I think the halo effect/viewing celebrities in a positive light does subconsciously exist within many fans. In a sense I guess this is quite petty of me though, i.e., it shouldn't matter who's responsible more, i.e. who started it, but that well-thought action should be taken to reprimand/resolve it for all parties involved. Probably won't happen though.;negative;;;;;
To keep it concise, I think you misunderstood my point and my stance. Sane people understand she's playing a character, of course. The mentally unstable, ignorant folk, obviously don't. I'm not saying that's it not toxic, just that it's difficult to fault certain folk, and that some people are turning a blind eye to certain predatory practices.;negative;;;;;

"I believe we're arguing about different things here, or rather, that there's a fine line within our discussion. First, let's start with some examples. Is it a child's fault if they take candy from a white van and end up dead? Is it a teenage girl's fault if she trusts her uncle and ends up hurt? Is it a person's fault if they commit a crime that they did not know was a crime and is not common sense to them? Assuming you're a ""reasonable"" person, these things are obviously not their faults. The fact is that they did not know any better, and that they were manipulated, whether intentional or not. You're walking a very fine line between discerning personal responsibility and victim blaming, or more generally, negligence (or stubbornness) and ignorance, respectively. At least, that's my take.

The primary point of my argument was that ignorance should not be faulted. I completely agree with accepting personal responsibility for things within your control. I'd like to think that we're in agreement here.

I'm not claiming ALL these angry fans don't know better. There are definitely a few fuckheads that put themselves in this position, knowing what the end result would be, adults acting like children who don't want to accept the truth. However, I'm going to claim the larger population of those who form these parasocial relationships, are unstable, neurotic individuals, who are stuck - whether it be depression, addiction, stress, etc. When you're stuck, you have no control. Many of those who are stuck don't have the proper tools - support network, money, healthy coping mechanisms - to properly unstuck themselves. In that sense, they are ignorant to how to fix themselves in a healthy, constructive manner, rather than latching onto something that will fuck them over. In this world, there are many things to do that, where people dangle it over their heads like candy because of greed, like drugs/alcohol, sex, video games, and in this case, parasocial relationships.

That specific content encourages those people that they don't need any help and that this is normal.

When Marine and Miko made fun of the BL manga and had to apologize, that's directly related to the planning of the stream. It was a mistake on their part as streamers.



When a pop-up appears on the screen with a personal message it's different.

Rushia should apologize for forgetting to keep it from apprearing, that's a mistake as a streamer. It's disruptive and unprofessional.

But not for the content of that message. That is her personal life every fan must turn a blind eye on that kind of things. ""Wasureru Beam"" and all of that.



About Cover having the means to prevent it. I don't know but I want to think that they try their best. I have read things on the internet about what they can or cannot do but in the end it's all hearsay. You cannot be sure about the truth anymore. That's why I try to not push my ideas about what Cover should do.

As a fan I must put some faith in the talent being an adult and businesspeople to manage their life and professional career. If they are putting their trust in their manager and Cover. I have nothing else to say. It's better not to pile up on them with our own ideas about the issues. We are thousands of people, many angry people. It's better to wait for good developments on this.

I'm not in the mindset that they cannot do wrong. It's that I prefer to be hopeful because I'm powerless anyway.";negative;;;;;

"Whether or not she created predatory content with malicious intent to get money is arguable, and I doubt that there's any way for us to prove it without knowledge that we can't get.

Something similar has happened before. Not Vtuber, but still an idol:

That depends on who you ask.

There are two major camps: The ""Who cares, let them do what they want"" camp and the ""Idols belong to the fans and if they date someone that means they're betraying me/us/them"" camp.

Typically, Japanese fans are more divided. Historically, more fall into the second camp, butt more and more Japanese fans seem to be speaking up about how the dating ban is bad, and things seem to be slowly changing. Takagi Sayuki, for example, had a lot of support, and Japanese fans were mostly outraged that she left Hello! Project.""

Although Hololive isn't the usual idol agency, doesn't prohibit Vtubers from dating somone, and most people don't really care whether Vtubers are dating, there always will be Gachikoi's who still hold the view that idols should be pure and belong to the fans. When rumors of their favorite idol (Virtual or not) is dating someone, it is almost guaranteed that Gachikoi's will react badly.

The GFE certainly is a big factor, but the point is this kind of situation can happen to anyone in the idol industry, not just Rushia. Thus, a culture thing.



PS: Don't confuse artists with idols, the term 'idol' in Japan is very different from the term artist.";negative;;;;;
It definitely is an idol culture thing. Similar things have happened to other japanese vtubers.;neutral;;;;;
Conspiracy theory but If you wanted out of Hololive and were done with it THIS would be the bang to go out with. Rushia has had to take a couple mental health breaks in the past so it wouldn't surprise me honestly. I do wish her the best though and if she wants to continue hopefully she can (Not a Fandead);negative;;;;;
Is it really surprising? I remember in 2021 or 2020 she leaked her discord front page and he was on top of her msgs. Some creeps started going through their tweets and a lot of stuff matched together like same food on same day, same things around house, going to same destinations on free days etc.;neutral;;;;;
Most people want to date someone who has a vaguely similar lifestyle, at least enough to understand what each other does all day and what parts might be hard/stressful. And even if they really are just friends the same thing might apply. So I think it's not too odd that if this was going to happen it would be with someone in a similar industry/position.;negative;;;;;
"when you make content the type of content define what your fanbase is. there is a little amount of crazy people online who would believe that yes.

Is it a child's fault if they take candy from a white van and end up dead?
A child is literally too young to know any better. An adult on the other hand...
Is it a teenage girl's fault if she trusts her uncle and ends up hurt?
Depends. Teenagers range from child to nearly adult. So if said teenager is old enough, and depending on who the uncle is, the answer becomes a bit more complex than ""She wasn't wrong to blindly trust her uncle"". I'm gonna take a bit of an extreme example, but if a 17 year old girl gets told by her parents that her uncle has a history of harming teenage girls and that he fully intend to harm her, yet she disregard what they say. Isn't she partly to blame for what ends up happening ?
Is it a person's fault if they commit a crime that they did not know was a crime and is not common sense to them
Once again, it depends. Saying you shouldn't be held accountable for your actions just because you didn't know is a bit easy. It's still your responsibility to check whether or not you have the right to do something, especially if you're in a foreign country. If someone, for any reason, doesn't know you need a license to drive a car, they'd still get arrested and punished for trying to drive one.
The primary point of my argument was that ignorance should not be faulted. I completely agree with accepting personal responsibility for things within your control. I'd like to think that we're in agreement here.
Where our opinion differ is that it's one's responsibility to become less and less ignorant as they age. You're in control of whether you learn, and therefore you're in control of how ignorant you are (up to a certain extent, as you can't know everything). It's fair to be defenseless as a child, however an adult that doesn't know any better than a child deserve to live every bad experience that results from his ignorance. A good example is racism. It often comes from a place of ignorance, should it therefore not be faulted ?
If someone genuinely thinks that having sex with women too drunk to say no is normal, should they not be blamed for what they do ?
As for your last paragraph : I think it's a little easy to say that most of those guys are nothing but the victims of their own circumstances.
To go even further, I'd actually argue that most people who are ""stuck"" as you say actually do have some amount of control over their situation (Else, no would ever recover from that on their own, and I know from personal experience this is false). The one's who genuinely have no control over their situation, with literally no way getting better on their own, are an infinitesimal amount. When someone has an unhealthy obsession with video games, you don't blame the video games companies. When someone eats an unhealthy amount of candy, you don't blame the candies companies. Similarly, if you fall in love with a anime avatar that just say clich©s overly attached girlfriend lines, you are expected to get your shit together.
Once again, I do agree that a very, very small amount of those people can't help it. But the majority definitely can.";negative;;;;;

These Vtuber / any streamer fans feel like they are part of the illusion, it feels much more real when said fake online persona is actively interacting with the fan base. 

It makes it so much easier for the mentally unwell and needy members of society to grow unhealthily attached to said fake online personas.

And movie stars are very public, very clear cut about the boundaries and differences between their irl persona and their movie personas. 

This isn't true for streamers, so once the illusion breaks, it has a far larger impact because it was never intended to break in such a manner.

right now they're not just the main target of their own antis and each others antis, but also overseas people eating up that narrative, the dating that they are trying to deny, while also bringing up GFE as this can of worm they're dipping their hands in for money.

"That's true, but that argument stops being valid if you're going out of your way to attract that sort of demographic.

Rushia is the most superchatted youtuber in the world for a reason: she's the biggest GFE vtuber in the entire world. GFE is by definition a tactic that encourages parasocial relationships in order to basically exploit morons with deep pockets.

And what's worse, she recently has gone waaaay overboard with this girlfriend fantasy roleplay: she literally was about to release an ENGAGEMENT RING as merch. That's beyond the point of reasonable doubt, it's outrageously obvious that Rushia was abusing her gachikoi fanbase that she herself bred.

The backlash she recieved from this incident has been amplified enormously precisely because she has been pandering to non-grass-touching losers for YEARS and getting rich off it.";negative;;;;;
"One thing is role-play, which is absolutely normal and acceptable, and it's what Rushia's doing with her fanbase (Also Nene but on a way goofier approach).

The downside is that it also attracts people with parasocial relationship disease, which they cannot discern what they're experiencing is just that, a game (wife role-play) and truly believes that they're Rushia's legitimate partner and nobody else's.

It doesn't help that Rushia's birthday merc includes a wedding ring (a gorgeous one tbh, I want one) and the bride acrylic stand

That's the problem I guess. You know what? I think I'll retract my train of thought. These people are mentally unwell, but not entirely out of their own volition. Japan's work culture is just as bad as Korea's work culture. Shit is toxic as fuck. And a lot of people are emotionally crippled in making relationships because of it.

"Calli is publicly friends with several male creators, one of them being streamer/content creator Cdawgva (the infamous monke, also known as Connor).

Some fans didn't like this, for one reason or another. It wasn't helped by the fact that Connor has had poor/poorly worded takes about vtubing and Hololive in the past, which have led to her being harassed for ""hating her co-workers/fans"" and shit like that.

More recently, there's been a rumour circulating that she's also in a relationship (which as we see here is always a shitshow for holo talent), and one of the names the floated regularly was Connor. Of course, certain gachis and antis whipped this into a frenzy and used much more colourful to describe Calli's relationship dynamics between her potential BF and her supachatting fans, and made it the new focus of their harassment of her.

Calli, in a now deleted tweet, snapped at someone on twitter with a very sarcastic reply to a piece of ""fan""art that was a part of this effort/narrative (iirc, might have been something different). This was blood in the water, and harassment got even worse. Calli took a break from scheduled streaming, alongside a now-ongoing full break for surgery. She's also changed her guidelines around supas and readings in light of this (it was an avenue they used to harass her through).

"Where our opinion differ is that it's one's responsibility to become less and less ignorant as they age. You're in control of whether you learn, and therefore you're in control of how ignorant you are (up to a certain extent, as you can't know everything). It's fair to be defenseless as a child, however an adult that doesn't know any better than a child deserve to live every bad experience that results from his ignorance.
A good example is racism. It often comes from a place of ignorance, should it therefore not be faulted ? If someone genuinely thinks that having sex with women too drunk to say no is normal, should they not be blamed for what they do ?
You mention victims of consequence later, but I'm going to start off by saying that I'd like to think victims of consequences are not as uncommon as you might think. Statistically, yes, an infinitesimal amount of people are true victims of consequences. However, human beings are not perfect beings, able to recognize and seize the important opportunities to fix their shit. To segue into your statement, there exist many incompetent (emotionally incompetent as well) people who are ill-equipped to become less ignorant as they age. There are racist folk who've grown up only in a racist environment, and are from lower IQ areas (not to say IQ means shit, but let's assume they're correlated and loosely use it as a measure of ""competence""). I agree that the behavior is wrong, and that we should still try our best to address it, but it's hard to expect much.
Similarly, the average IQs for violent crime offenders is significantly lower than non-criminals. Same spiel as above. Similarly with emotional intelligence.
I think the above discussion we're having is straying a bit off-topic though, so back to the situation at hand.
As for your last paragraph : I think it's a little easy to say that most of those guys are nothing but the victims of their own circumstances. To go even further, I'd actually argue that most people who are ""stuck"" as you say actually do have some amount of control over their situation (Else, no would ever recover from that on their own, and I know from personal experience this is false). The one's who genuinely have no control over their situation, with literally no way getting better on their own, are an infinitesimal amount. I should have elaborated a bit more that I believe that people within that headspace perceive that they have no control, which is effectively, having no control. Unless, that's what you understood it as. I'm not saying they're all victims of their own circumstance, but more like victims of a stuck mindstate and overall being imperfect as human beings (similar to my spiel on incompetence). From my own personal experience, only in hindsight I can see ways I could have loosened myself quicker. I was stuck in what felt to be a never ending cycle of negativity, and leeching onto convenient outs was a way to cope. Or maybe I'm just mentally weak lol. Regardless, we have our own experiences which we've built up our beliefs on, and I'm thinking it might be difficult to reach understanding here without directly knowing what each of us has gone through. Statistically, obviously most are not victims to their own circumstances, so we agree there. When someone has an unhealthy obsession with video games, you don't blame the video games companies. When someone eats an unhealthy amount of candy, you don't blame the candies companies.
Similarly, if you fall in love with a anime avatar that just say clich©s overly attached girlfriend lines, you are expected to get your shit together.
My main stance is that both parties are ultimately screwed up and at fault which we both agree with, but not that majority of the fault should be placed on the crazy viewers. That being said, I don't think there's a way to define an objective and discrete metric to measure blame, and up to that point we're just getting silly. Maybe I'm assigning more blame to Hololive/Rushia subconsciously to compensate for me perceiving a larger number of people doing the reverse. The companies are predatory (video game companies lootboxes, candy companies advertising placement) in the name of greed (though maybe you can argue all human beings are innately greedy, and thus hard to blame, but still they fucked up). The people who get sucked into it generally should know better, but in a fucked mindstate it's hard for me to blame them (though what they're doing is still incredibly toxic). Nevertheless, you reap what you sow. I don't think Rushia deserves to get cancelled or anything like that, but that this was anticipated, and something like being cancelled could easily happen because of the volatility of the internet.";negative;;;;;

"I'm just saying that I don't agree with the assertion that her content was designed to specifically profit off these vulnerable groups. If you look thru the surge of controversy, you can see that much of her followers still reacted to the situation sensibly, which shows that her character being what it is isn't necessarily designed to force people into acting with obsession

In this case, isn't the problem then be the fact that these people don't have access to professional help? 

I agree implied relationship content plus the implications of her merch can cause some groups to react badly to it, but no one forces anyone to watch it. The way I see it, a group of people who should not have chosen to partake of her content ended up reacting badly to it due to the lack of safeguards we have for them.

Tldr her content shouldn't cause any issues if you know how to deal with it, and those unfortunate enough to have adversely reacted to it should have had access to professional help, or at the very least chosen to use other forms of entertainment";negative;;;;;

If me saying ""harassing a streamer is bad"" is a one sided dismissal, I think you may have some other problems.

Heck, I bet EN fans would be like ""bring your bf/husband on!"" or whatever just to mess around with them. They're often a crapshoot for personality but when a creator brings their significant other on and they're just as whacky as they are it just adds to the enjoyment.";negative;;;;;

Like if a dude is donating thousands of dollars to you every month, and they clearly view you as an actual girlfriend that they expect to stay faithful, rather than just a fantasy. 

Not their fucking problem. People thinking that some cute anime girl pretending to be you're girlfriend is actually your girlfriend is the actual problem.

"This 'rule' for being an idol isn't for their safety, but to maintain the parasocial fantasy. It's the other side of the coin with the old ""Markiplier/Jacksepticeye"" shit - most of their fans are completely fine, but a subset of their fans take things way too far, thinking that their job as performers should leech further into their daily lives.

Rushia being in contact with a man in a more than professional way should not stoke this much anger. I absolutely can blame people for being mad. Thing is, these streamers are great, even for GFE. At the end of the day, it's the consumers who need to monitor their own consumption. I don't think that I actually have a GF when I listen to someone do a voiceless ASMR stream, but it's comforting regardless. I can empathize with the feeling of fans, feelings can rarely be controlled, but the hate Rushia got is completely unwarranted imo.";negative;;;;;
"""With all respect to her personal life, fuck her personal life, she don't have any"".

Dude, her job consists of a) streaming b) attending to meetings. Anything beyond that is her business and not ours.

And it's a fucked up ""rule"". If she wants to hide her relationship in order to separate private life from work, fine so be it. The problem is that in actuality she has to do so otherwise she gets cancelled, potentially ruining her career and her partner's. That's SO FUCKED UP.";negative;;;;;
"You're assuming GFE/BFE is manipulation, which is not. Vtubers are characters, she's literally playing a fictional character who's acting as a fake GF! there's at least two layers of separation between the person behind the character and the viewers.

Rather than not watching her often it's more accurate to say I rarely watch her, so I didn't know what she usually do. I only know that she sometimes play apex like towa, and that in terms of personality she's quite open to talking about things ppl won't usually expect from an idol;negative;;;;;

You're missing the point. Gachikois are very far from being the only ones her content appeal to, which is why she's gonna be just fine once this whole thing calm down. Close to everyone who enjoy GFE/BFE are rational, normal human beings who wants a bit of escapism in their life. GFE is a entire type of videos on YouTube (And looking at her content, I feel people are wildly exaggerating how ham she went). Arguing that she actively try to cater to these people seems to me as wrong as saying that bars tries to cater to alcoholics. That's why it's so jarring to see people arguing she had it coming, rather than arguing against the people who should get their shit together.;negative;;;;;
Ah I see thank you for explaining the meaning;positive;;;;;
I think it's probably more like she only has a work Discord. I seem to remember reading somewhere that none of the Hololive talents (or at least very few of them) had Discord accounts at all until Coco introduced them to it to play ARK together.

'actual issue'ù is not some people with free time managed to raise hell, 
is that there's hell to be raised with in the first place.

in this rushia/mafu case the actual issue really is people with free time managing to raise hell. think about it, rushia/ mafu and many streamers has been doing it all this time so why suddenly did it become a hot topic now? and why these two in particular?

because antis managed to spin a technical mishap into a full blown scandal. this whole discussion went from ""rushia/mafu is dating"" to ""rushia/much is reaping what they sow because they're offering GFE while dating"" to ""GFE bad"". this really couldve ended with ""fake news, rushia/mafu not dating, gachikois relieved"" and everything wouldve been back to 'normal'.

sure GFE is a can of worms, but its a whole streamer industry thing and its going to keep going on regardless of if it gets talked about it here. the difference now is that these 2 are now forever stigmatized and will be used as examples whenever GFE issue comes up, despite the fact that the whole scandal is just a made up fake narrative pulled by antis. the only ones coming out of this with a big smile on their face is the antis that raised hell and the randoms enjoying this as a past time drama.

theres a noticable difference in [comments simply presenting how GFE is a bad thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/sptjo2/comment/hwj0cbg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [comments based on the premise that they are dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/sptjo2/comment/hwhq7vj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). just gotta read between the lines because once you read them under the context that they're not dating, the latter starts giving this ""why is this talking as if they're dating for real?"" vibe.";negative;;;;;

Neither of them does anything remotely like BFE/GFE experience streams and they still had a bunch of broken insane people thinking they were dedicated to them.

But I think this comment here explains it much better, than I do: https://old.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/spq06e/some_of_yall_read_to_go_outside_like_genuinely/hwh0coz/

"You are expecting rationality from people who spent thousands of dollars on her (or other streamers). These huge superchats they are sending are probably getting extra attention from Rushia herself. So yes, they are somehow treated differently than most other viewers.

I can just repeat myself: those people need psychological help and Rushia should know that. She should also know that her behavior encourages those people. 

So can we just stop putting blame on the people that need therapy? It's no fucking surprise that so many people still think that going to a therapist is somehow bad, when everyone behaves like that.";negative;;;;;
"I probably should've worded that better, I guess.

People that take the GFE stuff too serious need psychological help, but Rushia shouldn't be surprised when those people get angry at her personal life. 

Fact is that her behavior attracts those kinda people and she should know that. As far as I know she never drew a line. Never said: ""I'm not really your girlfriend"" or something alike. 

Should it be obvious? Yes, but those people don't necessarily think about that. They are just happy that someone likes them. They don't see the difference between her playing a character and her real-self.

Also it doesn't help that those people are probably the same ones that get her the most money. Another thing that lets them believe Rushia belongs to them.

Like why do GFE at all? What does it do, but strengthen parasocial relationships?";negative;;;;;
From my understanding, her business model seems to target these mentally vulnerable people, or, dare I say, menhera. She brand herself as a menhera and sell this menhera girlfriend experience to these people, and one of her merchandise is a ring. If your entire business model is build upon taking money from mentally sick people, then you are knowingly taking advantage of them, and you surely should bear a certain level responsibility for the situation. Imagine selling guns in low-income high-crime-rate neighbourhood, then tell people that the increased gun-related crimes has nothing to do with you, and that it's entirely the responsibility of the users to ensure the safe use of guns.;neutral;;;;;

it's their money after all and at the end of the day, just like people spend thousands on gacha games with no real gain at the end other than a small sense of accomplishment, sending SC's can have a similar end goal.

But then again it's not the first time somebody wanted to stab even just the seiyuu of their favorite anime character because she got married...

"Except most Twitch streamers aren't doing obvious character bits (except maybe DrDisrespect). Hololive, and especially Rushia, often do. She plays into a yandere character and it's obvious to anyone sane that it's entertainment. No, she's not going to murder you for having a gf or watching other streamers, shocking, right? The ring and similar things are part of that.

It's as stupid as blaming TV actors for being attacked because someone didn't like the character they played in a show. (And yes, that also happens every once in a while, because guess what, people are morons and it's not anyone else's fault).";negative;;;;;

"Of course there are vtubers who play as themselves, I remember Matsuri being one of them. But even that is playing a character in it of itself, just an exaggerated and idealized version of themselves (like Twitch streamers and regular YouTubers do).

It makes me feel like a parent letting their kid leave the family home hoping for the best whenever she takes autonomy and acts on her own accord for the first time...

It's just a more realistic situation involving normal people running an indie project and it's just heartwarming to see how the character can grow as a person.

Like in the beginning she's pretty nihilistic and calls her fans nerds purely exploring them but later as she grows fond of them and grows from interacting with people she starts calling them ""my nerds"" and even lands on them when struggling with her suicidal urges.

It's just very good writing with clear familiarity with the industry I recommend checking the game out.";positive;;;;;
"I am probably a menhera at this point anyway and I will admit that I do feel disappointed when I heard about this situation. 

I know that whatever vtuber do in their real life is their own business and fans shouldn't have any say in it but well Rushia did sell the GFE and I am hooked in because of it.

"and if people discovered they arent dating to begin with there wouldnt have been an issue either. until that discord msg nobody ever talked about this. nobody even knew about this, much less think they're dating. the reason antis really wanted to pull this on them is mainly because they are very successful. 

one is a very famous utaite with 3mil+ subs and the other is youtube top SC earner that kept getting on news despite being a ""shitty picture"" to boot. anyone would be delusional to think they did this for the goodness of mankind or something. 

you want cover and the industry in general to stop offering GFE? that's just you forcing your own desires on cover. GFE exists long before cover and they are not obligated to do something about it. if anything there are reasons it sells so if you really want it gone you should be starting from the reason people start relying on GFE first.

there absolutely are comments that insists they're dating even after the OP updates, hell there's a whole rushia/mafu wedding pic in front page on this very sub. but sure here's some sorted-by-new comments that didnt catch the memo

Rushia isn't the number one superchats earner for no reason. I'm not saying she's doing it maliciously, but she should know what kinda audience she's attracting and like all other streamers she has at least some responsibility.

"Thanks, Putin.

Lol but jokes aside, thank you for real. Good looking out.

And to highlight this, so hopefully people will take this the right way:

OP is not shaming you, or anyone else. They're trying to give you a heads up that VTubers can have downsides like any other form of entertainment.

 ""...being said, some degree of attachement is perfectly healthy and normal, I'm not saying that you shouldn't care about them, just don't let it take over your life.""

 ""Caring about a vtuber or enjoying their their content is normal, but getting to a point where you ""need"" their content to be happy is a sign that you might have an issues with it.""

Agreed. It is very natural to develop empathy, adoration, admiration and respect for a VTuber when you like them and end up watching them regularly. They are after all, real people behind the avatar.

Perhaps you may even go on to join their membership or buy their goods.

That's fine, too. It is also natural for you to feel that you should give back, and make them happy just as they have done for you.

My point being, if you feel ashamed by this post, rest easy knowing that none of these aforementioned behaviours are parasocial.

Just know that the line is there and that you see it clearly with this advice, so you don't have to suffer. Or make anyone else suffer.";positive;;;;;
So what you're saying is, I need to send even MORE max red SC's until Astel realize I'm serious for him!?;neutral;;;;;
"I unironically developed one /w Amelia Watson, but I've cancelled my membership and I haven't watched any of her streams in a month. I was staying awake at ungodly hours(2am-4am) just to watch her streams, and I remember watching and literally archiving every stream she did starting from when she debuted because I was afraid I'd miss out on something. I used to watch Subaru a lot, but I've never developed a parasocial relationship with her because I don't understand Japanese at all. Being able to understand what a vtuber was saying, feeling and thinking was enough for me to develop an unhealthy parasocial relationship. When absolutely nothing in your life is going well you'll use anything as a coping mechanism, I guess I used Amelia's streams to cope with how my life was going.

At the end of the day, its important to realize it doesn't matter what happens I guess. You could stop watching their streams tomorrow and stop donating, and they wouldn't even notice you were gone at all. It's not bad to watch be inspired by vtubers per se, but when you've begun to watch vtubers for other reasons other than entertainment, you need realize what other things in your life you've substituted over them.

Sorry for the essay, just hoping that this helps anyone if they've begun feeling this way towards any vtubers recently, with everything in the world going to shit and all.";negative;;;;;
"I do find the vtubers alot better at not encouraging this behaviour. 

For example Matsuri turning off super chats because the viewers got carried away during an Apex stream. Or Marine reminding a viewer who sent a large superchat that while she was  thankful, he didn't need to donate so much to support her. Or Ina, who borderline discourages donation.

These girls could exploit their viewers and make this problem worse but thankfully many of them are decent human beings at least.";negative;;;;;

Broke up with my girlfriend because I know one day I'll marry Okayu.  Even told my parents.  Lmao;negative;;;;;
I think this is especially true for vtubers. They inherently present themselves as an anime character, an idealized persona. I look at comment sections in some song covers that they make and people are unironically saying things to the effect of, ‚ÄúSo this is how people feel about Popular Artist A, but my feelings for Vtuber B is genuine and not fake like those other fans‚Äù and they get hundreds of likes, the absolute hypocrisy is insane. And the passive aggressiveness a lot of Vtuber fans talk about ‚Äúregular‚Äù streamers. People, theres no inherent difference between a Vtuber and any other artist/streamer other than their anime avatars. They do not somehow become objectively more valuable because their avatar is cute. Its all kayfabe and most people understand that, but I genuinely believe that a lot of people subconsciously hold them to different standards by virtue of their anime avatars alone.;negative;;;;;
Yeah for sure. We are just generic fan x, generic fan Y, generic fan z, generic fan + in the end.;positive;;;;;
"This is a great post to raise awareness of these issues. But i will say a lot of the fans on the Hololive sub act like this tbh, they seem way to invested in the talents on a personal level especially now since the English talents are here and established.

It makes more sense to act like this with a smaller VTuber (double digit views) as the chat for more like a personal experience rather than thousands of randoms all speaking at once.";positive;;;;;

SIMP (parody of KING) by Jaret Fajrianto [https://youtu.be/jjAJ0tPk6lc](https://youtu.be/jjAJ0tPk6lc) (English captions available)

Lyrics:

You're looking at someone's livestream

A cute character in two dimension

You're captivated and attracted

With the beautiful, wonderful design



What they are doing really makes you fall in love with them

When you imagine it, it makes your cheek so bright and red

Then you prepare yourself to waste all the money you've got

You hope you get to be noticed by them for once



You spend all of your free time just to watch them do things

You send certain 'marshmallow' written in 'wangy wangy'

You give up all of your treasures just to support them

And you hope to get a happy ending



Calm down! Calm down! Don't give in into the rush!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Hallucination time!

Calm down! Calm down! Now you are hoping too much!



Ha! Ha! Ha! Haha!

YOU ARE SIMP





Just support them all you can, and don't you run away from the fact

That you two are living in, different dimension after all

Just imagine they're your friends, who always keep you accompanied

Just donate them when you can, and they will always feel grateful to you



You spend all of your free time just to watch them do things

You send certain 'marshmallow' written in 'wangy wangy'

You give up all of your treasures just to support them

And you hope to get a happy ending



Calm down! Calm down! Don't give in into the rush!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Hallucination time!

Calm down! Calm down! Now you are hoping too much!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Haha!

YOU ARE SIMP

YOU ARE SIMP!";positive;;;;;
"Im gonna try answering these as objectively as I can:

I havent changed any of my real life relationships because of vtubers. There was a time when I was watching them when I shouldve been sleeping, but Im pretty over that point in my life now. I have spent money on them, nothing to crazy like $100, but it was mostly to say something funny in a message. I view them as entertainers who are friendly to their audience. Its kinda hard to imagine them as personal friends with an audience you can see. Never been jealous of what goes on in their lives. 

In short, I enjoy watching them for the funny content, but I havent formed any parasocial relationships; however, I think I might wanna consider turning off YouTube notifications to focus on important parts of my own life/time.";negative;;;;;
In fact I think supporting streamers with a small audience can easily lead to such way of thought. Even more dangerous when the viewer feels the streamer 'owes' the viewer for being there when they started out. I can imagine some people feeling 'possessive' and even disliking when even the streamer gains success. When membership chat begins to go zoom, the viewer might feel he had lost the previous more personal atmosphere where the streamer could more easily pick out his comments.;negative;;;;;
Someone did this to me with my first 5 followers. It evolved into stalking, I don't think he understood that I'm not his friend and I don't want him sending me gifts. I ended up quiting and completely restarted.;negative;;;;;
"I wished this needn't be said but thank goodness you said it. Vtubers are entertainers first and foremost, and we are consuming the product that they produce. No matter how much money or emotions you throw at them, you are NOT their personal friends.

Sure, they may draw a closer line with their candidness about their lives and personalities but at the end of the day, you and them are only in a consumer-provider relationship. 

It is the failure to recognise this that makes the entire relationship go sour especially when the Vtuber does something that does not conform to one's expectations, resulting in people feeling betrayed etc. 

It's fine to see Vtubers as one of your emotional support, but it shouldn't be a main pillar. The girls are out to entertain the masses, and none of them has any obligations towards you as a person.";negative;;;;;
"Thank you for making this thread, I needed this reminder.

Vtubers can be so charming that if you don't have much going on in your daily life, you get easily allured by these bright personalities. Like a moth to a flame.";positive;;;;;
"For me, I'm attached to YouTube, not the streamers themselves per see. I'm a uni student with online classes so I consume vtuber streams whenever I'm doing assignments or attending boring lectures. I agree I do desire human interactions and will tune in to a currently live vtuber to break the monotony. If not then I'm listening to podcasts or music.

No, I don't view vtubers as friends, I view them as figures we all love and respect. I sometimes superchat during milestones and sometimes for memes because I wanna support them. It's never about me. It's their stream and we are audiences.

And no, please don't take oil barons with gigantic akasupas as simps. The ones I see are either for the memes or during milestones. Someone who forms said parasocial relationship will make the superchat about themselves, and I've seen it.

I'm also aware of people who devotes lot's of attention to their favourite vtuber, interacting, superchatting and tweeting. I'm a fan of Kiara and always notice the presence of the usual big KFP employees. I don't think they are mad simping, they know the stream revolves around Kiara, not themselves and behave accordingly.";negative;;;;;
Completely agree. The people who superchat and apologize for not being able to give more make me a lil sad, im sure just watching their content is more than enough to make them happy!;neutral;;;;;

"I'm so relate to this. Couple years ago, I'm having huge breakdown because some idol from certain group announcing her graduation. I'm instantly depressed, especially since she was on hiatus for quite sometimes, and rather than a comeback, she announcing graduation. I literally cried and became so gloomy. My family even ask me why my face looks so depressed, but since I never tell about my hobby, I never able to talk about it with my family and brush it off like I don't have any problems. Fortunately, I have a buddy that helps me overcome this situation. Almost everyday I tell him how depressed I am because of this event, how I care so much about this idol, etc. At that time, as I recall, he never ridicule me, heck, he even didn't say much about it. He just there and listen to my story. As times passing by, I became less and less depressed, till I finally can overcome it. Both of us didn't even know the term 'parasocial relationship' at that time, but we are know that my condition at that times was not healthy. 

Nowadays, reflecting on my past, I tried my best to set some boundaries between myself and those entertainers so it will not disrupt my life. For example, even though I watch Vtubers extensively, some times joking with my GF that Vtubers are cuter than her, I still take her to a date, playing videogames together, etc. Sometimes I also joking with my friend, asking question like wether I'm going to depressed again or not when my favorite Vtuber graduate.

If you happen to exhibit the 'symptoms' that OP mentioned, my advice is find someones you can talk to. I know it's not that simple, but at least try it. It maybe not work for all people, but at least it works for me.";negative;;;;;

"This is very important to remember. I really enjoy watching the stream of a certain vtuber because she tries her best being an entretainer, but sometimes I just want to turn off the chat or even leave the stream because the people in there are unable to distinguish reality from fiction and try too hard going ""notice me sempai"". Last time people were inventing r/thathappened stories just to impress the host.

One thing I love about vtubers is that I always thought, back in the days when LP was big, real people were too much of a distraction of what happened in-screen (that's why I preferred LPs without any commentary whatsoever, or LPs where the commentary was just text). I think I can enjoy streams better with a virtual avatar because it feels like it's just as a much of a ""show"" than what's happening in-game. We can't deny that's pretty nice when the host acknowledges us and reply to when we comment on something and present ourselves, but it's just basic courtesy, you can do it in real life as well.";negative;;;;;
I kinda just saw them as another form of anime to watch;neutral;;;;;
I can appreciate the good intentions behind the message, but people who form that kind of parasocial relationships (who obsess with or actually believe they have a some sort of deep connection with the person behind the avatar, to put it bluntly) have other sort issues that go beyond loneliness or mere boredom, I don't know how effective it can be.;neutral;;;;;
If you went up to them in the street they would probably call the police. ;positive;;;;;

"Hear, hear! 

In a similar vein I was witness to an incident that affected the vtuber. There was this one vtuber I follow and they are very interactive with the viewers both on stream and on twitter. Very cheery, friendly, inviting. At some point, one of the fans suddenly poured their heart out about a hardship they are currently going through. Sent via twitter DM. Imagine a wall of text. I only ever saw the last part of the events but due to this, the vtuber had to post on twitter about not doing that, in a kind way of course. Reminding their followers that there is also a person behind and are going through their own hardships IRL too and do not have the capacity of catering to basically strangers.

The worse part is the ""damage control"" that the fan did after realizing what they did. Like they had to keep saying sorry messages. When the right step was to just say sorry and leave it at that.";negative;;;;;
"I understand why people form these types of relationships, but it just baffles me everytime I hear about it.

If anything, I'm obsessed with the medium in general, but not one girl in particular. I barely even go into streams and have never watched an entire archived or live stream unless I fell asleep or was doing something else while watching. I mostly know everything through clips and memes.

It's interesting to hear about and I hope these people get help or learn to break out of this unhealthy type of relationship themselves.";negative;;;;;
You wanna know what's a good mental refresh to me in terms of vtubers even though I don't have an issue with parasocial relationships? I know it may sound really, REALLY weird but my mental refresh is Holo no Grafitti. That show makes me view vtubers as characters in an anime and it's probably my favorite anime for that reason.

But now that her sub count has exploded, her financial situation has gotten better, I feel myself withdrawing a bit. Kinda feeling like a job well done. Ill still stay subbed ofcourse, but wont stay in her chat for hours on end. I feel like I was part of something special.;negative;;;;;

"This definitely does seem like a legitimate concern. Many of us joke about it a bit too much for it to not have some grain of truth, I would think.

Although, I was under the impression a parasocial relationship needn't necessarily be so extreme. I honestly thought that it just referred to any sort of one-sided relationship, and that the problem was when such feelings became toxic or perverted in the traditional sense. I suppose it makes sense, though, since perceiving it as a significant relationship on a personal level would be strange.";negative;;;;;

Do you feel like you need to spend money on them?

I like supporting my fav with the extra money can take from non essential expenses

Do you view them as a friend, or worse, a romantic relationship?

The character and experience yes, I think this question overlooks the huge kaifabe into all of this.

Are you jealous of them spending time with other people in their life outside being a vtuber?

What's my diagnose sensei? Am I too far gone? Am I sane?

Jokes aside, I think a big part of this all is a fantasy bubble, a fantasy bubble that 95% of people is aware of, included the Vtuber, a safe space everyone is happy with interacting with each other, and ofc there is people who isn't normal and won't take it that way, but as long as you are aware and keep it in a healty way, I don't see a problem.";negative;;;;;

Does it count if I have a parasocial relationship with all of the vtubers?;positive;;;;;
If moneys involved. It should always be something to be weary of, even those not vtubing.

I would also recommend thinking about where your money is going. A decent cut of superchats/bits/subs/memberships go to YouTube/Twitch etc, and a cut of the remaining money also goes to whatever company owns the VTuber agency the VTuber is part of (this bit doesn't apply to indie VTubers). Bear in mind that no matter how much you like the VTuber, the company behind them will have different goals and ways of operating to the VTuber themselves;negative;;;;;
good writeup and reality check for a lot of us! Thanks;positive;;;;;
I agree, I honestly feel this really applies to heavy superchatters. People constantly dropping 100's on vtubers. Dropping small amounts is fine as it's like tipping but when people drop 100's it just seems crazy as if they have some idea that it will bring them closer to the content creator.;negative;;;;;
"There is one easy trick to realize that it is not a relationship, well it is not even friendship or companionship. Almost  with certainty  they don't know you.

If you can find this person there, then it is not worth any effort or money.   
Vtubers are divided into 2 categories. Those who interact with viewers personally and those who earn money. It is a calculated  psychological trick to make viewers more invested so that you would earn more. One example. Very easy. Vtubers won't say my real name which I use on YT. They will always butcher it or give me some kind of abbreviation. No matter if it is JP, EN, CN or even my own country. They will do what they can to avoid any personal interaction.";negative;;;;;
"Thank you for the post, OP.

I've been wondering whether I should post about this myself.

Seems like I've been speedrunning attachment-detachment with Ina these past few months. She's really good at... talking to her audience as if they're close friends. Logically I know that's not true, but I still felt attached to her. I wanted to avoid cancelling my membership though, so for now I just mostly keep chat closed and try to catch more VODs and not watch all livestreams. This way it feels like less of a conversation. It's kinda painful thinking that you'll never talk to this person, but at least with awareness of how you feel maybe you can still enjoy their content if it does make you happy.";negative;;;;;
As long as you don't go full Perfect Blue I don't see what the harm is. Your attachment will always be one-sided but if you're okay with that, who's the victim?;positive;;;;;
[Artia said this a while back.](https://youtu.be/0NLw-SDzfXM);positive;;;;;
Jealous? Bro are you serious? I WISH they'd talk more about their experiences with their friends, maybe even bring some on stream lol.;neutral;;;;;
"It's so easy to say what you are saying when you are in a happy and stable life right now. I've seen a couple of the stories of fans and not everybody has it perfect and vtubers are their escape. Saying to ""fix"" your problem is so simple minded too. 

I'm not that attached to vtubers but a little bit of empathy for other fans would be nice. I used to think like this too but I heard how some fans have a rough family background and they feel better when they watch their favorite vtubers. Who are we to say ""fix"" your family?";negative;;;;;
"I can't say the same for the youtube-centric crowd especially and unfortunately. I have also said this, only to be called an anti. It's that mindset is one of the many reasons, is to why there are antis.

"The more people become Vtubers the more will deny relationships, family and even the people out there in the real world, plus loneliness will increase even more which is a RED FLAG! I have the Feeling that The ""Vtuber Community"" is NOT a ""Community"" Because is a very anti-social environment like ""Twitch"" which no one can't speak freely with confidence.



 And when I mean NOT speaking freely I don't mean Cancel culture or getting banned, but I mean.... ""Small talks"" and questions about normal things in ""real life"" (like how are you?, and what you like to do?)  which makes an antisocial  person gets triggered and uncomfortable which is ridiculous and stupid and NOT OKAY.

 This behaviour must STOP cuz is destroying the social interaction of everyone including myself and people should also make face reveal instead of talking to anime avatar that is not real.  Vtubers always says we are humans as well and you should treat us equally"", but they never make face reveals and they don't behave like human beings. Humans are sociable creatures cuz that's where communities comes from. And I'm NOT saying people should talk about religion or politics or their personal life... absolutely NO.  

I respect that people are anti-social and want to their privacy but...  being on that higher level of close-minded, Normie or whateve ENOUGH is ENOUGH cuz.... is ruinning our human interraction and purposes to build relationships. 

Vtubers should go outside and act like humans like the rest of us, otherwise loneliness will rise even more!



Just look Ironmouse for example, I saw her real face and I know she has like a tube or something on her nose cuz of her diagnosed disease she's been mentioning but we never see her interacting with connor in real life OR at LEAST.... see Iron Mouse holding hands with Connor behind the scenes. 

She always keep using her avatar to say that she is in a relationship with connor but doesn't seems like it cuz she doesn't cuddle with him or touch his flesh, instead of being  artificial or anonymous. 



Even A Catholic Nun who's a philosopher told me that what destroys human interraction is when ""they never remove the mask behind curtains"" meaning no one wants to show their face while taking to someone online or outside of social media. 

Vtubers especially Hollolive..... take the dam ""red Pill""

cuz....

We are in the ""Real world"" 

Not in ""The Matrix""";negative;;;;;
I was gonna link Ludwigs video then you mentioned it lmao;positive;;;;;
"Using a throwaway to comment on this.

Most of the time I'm going to agree with OP, but if you are serious about your feeling toward your favorite vtuber, you should as well give it a go.

Before attempting to do anything, there are a few things you should be aware of:

1. Agencies generally forbid private conversation between their vtubers and normal fans. A few lesser known vtuber actually got terminated because of this.

2. Agencies generally do not allow their vtuber to reveal their real identities to non-vtuber. Well if their fans somehow guess it out then it's ok though.

Basically, it's almost impossible to have a private conversation with your favorite vtuber. You will have to try to gain their attention under public eyes and hope the vtuber notice what you said, which is very difficult. Even if you somehow grab their attention, it's almost impossible to go anywhere beyond being a simple regular viewer, as the vtuber should be forbidden to talk to you. Your best shot would be to become a vtuber yourself, as you will probably be allowed to have private conversation with them. 

Also the vtuber themselves definitely did skimmer through their contract paper and took the job knowing they can't talk privately to their viewer. They are not actively seeking for relationship.

If you have read all of this, and still want to pursue the person behind the anime avatar, then good luck. You would have to make them fall for you just like irl, while considering everything I said above. Remember, while the avatar is anime, the person behind the avatar is not. They will not automatically fall in love with you like your 2D ex-girlfriends. Going after a vtuber is just as difficult, if not even harder, than going after sb irl.



So, what I'm trying to say here is that if you are THAT kind of fan, you still have a chance, a very slim one, though. Unless you really love them I'd suggest you try your luck with somebody else, really. If you really do love them though I won't stop you. It's cooler to try and fail rather than giving up from the start.";positive;;;;;
This would also be true for streamers in general too. The few I enjoy like Kaif aren't afraid to remind people to take care of themselves first when people attach notes to their donations that sound like they're doing so at the expense of their own welfare, whether or not that's a joke;negative;;;;;

Not really sure what might be an easy way to help these people to get out of it though. Recognizing they have a problem would definitely help, other that that, maybe get a pet?";negative;;;;;

I know Kiara is just an act, in fact I am in love with the characters of Hololive, not the people that manage the characters... If that makes sense. I know how to separate the art from the artist... I have met people that think that these characters are ""real"", they think the personalities and voice are authentic to the day to  day lives of the people in their real lives.    


I'm a performer IRL, so I do know what it's like to have !simps!<. Even in streaming, I used to be on an app and I def had some people take it too far there as well. Unfortunately, we cannot prevent people from having unhealthy attachments, at least in the digital world people don't think they have the right to grab you inappropriately based on your costume and your job (e.g. gogo dancing).  There will always be people that buy in a little too hard, such as the people that think the bartender is actually into you. It's nice to remind people of this, so thank you.";negative;;;;;
"I think most people here that commented have or already accepted this to be a fact even if it is a spectrum of opinions. I myself thought I was in this relationship but really I was just hyped for Vtubers for like 3 months and then it died down and I started ubsubbing to the ones I genuinely don't enjoy watching. (I used to be like ooh vtuber? Subscribed!) This really does give the same vibes I think a twitch streamer Ludwig made on ""I'm not your friend"" in which he just says we should see him and some other streamers as a TV show. If it gets boring then just go elsewhere, he wants you to stay for the content and not really for him as a person.";negative;;;;;
"This is a very intriguing topic- I am glad that many of us, as viewers, can be self-aware about the dangers. I think about it a lot from time to time. I believe its smart to always be reflective about it, and find a balance in enjoying the content that these Vtubers put out.

This is a bit of speculation, and not to be taken as fact, but this is why I kinda think Fubuki from Hololive JP likes to call her viewers ""friends""- I feel like, in some way, it encourages a healthy boundary between the viewer and the streamer. I do think that a lot of the Vtubers from Hololive know how to handle this type of situation in good ways, as well.

I don't know what is safe and what could set me down a bad path, so I've been trying to keep myself detached. I hardly ever type in chat (and when I do it's more running commentary than any attempt at communicating with the vtuber), and I don't dare contemplate sending superchats.";negative;;;;;
"- Are you changing your real life relationships because of vtubers?

Uh, I dunno how to explain this well, but I'll try. I don't have a lot of real life relationships, what I have atm can be prolly counted in one or two hands. Afaik, my relationship with my partner and brothers is still the same. Nothing changed much after I began watching vtubers... if anything else, we all got something new to talk and bond on.


- Are you able to take a break from watching without serious withdrawal?

I guess yes. I don't watch all of their live streams, only ones I can catch or I'm interested in. And I can easily leave a stream if I need/want to. On weekends I tend not to watch any of them since I treat the weekends as my break days, unless there's a special stream or something.


- Do you feel like you need to spend money on them?

Need? Not really. I am on membership for a few of them because I like their member exclusive content, little as those are lol. I do spend on the voice packs I like though. And I'm not broke or anything from it... I guess its something I carried from my days into a being a big fan of some KPop idols.

- Do you view them as a friend, or worse, a romantic relationship?

Hmmm nah. They're like an actor/actress in mt eyes.


- Are you jealous of them spending time with other people in their life outside being a vtuber?

Nope lol. I honestly don't give much shit on their IRL personalities. I do get worried when they share something concerning about their IRLs, but yeah I don't really care about their IRLs. I'm into the character they play/portray (if there is one) and their content.";negative;;;;;

This is true. There's a streamer I follow that ended up cutting audience interaction for a while because they felt betrayed by comments made by fans they perceived as regulars and friends.;positive;;;;;
Yeah, unfortunately, parasocial relationships can be made in both directions. Let's just not be too obsessive, many incidents have occured this way.;negative;;;;;
Only one vtuber that I watch has given me the feeling that she may think too highly of her chat, and thats Takanashi Kiara, sometimes rather than she being our virtual girlfriend, as she puts it, it feels more like the chat is her virtual boyfriend, which is great content wise but I worry she cares too much about what chat says.;negative;;;;;
I think chat can also be a support for Vtubers too. I was watching Snuffy's birthday stream last night, and if you don't know, she has a very high pitched voice. She was really stressed and crying because she decided to use her normal voice which is much more monotone. Chat loved it, even though she worried people would hate it and abandon her over something that silly, and I think it did a good job of helping with her self confidence in her voice. I think chat is somewhere between your friends and strangers, depending on your community obviously.;negative;;;;;
"I unironically am worried that gura has/is forming one with chat. Atleast a lot of her membership streams can feel like she is.

"Exactly, I don't want to shame anyone for being emotionally attached to a vtuber, it's natural. We haven't evolved with mass media so our brain starts treating them like a friend we talk to; if someone listens to a stream for several hours a week the brain starts thinking of them as a friend or in some cases as a romantic interest. I think we all feel the part of us that views them as a relationship, my post is just trying to remind people to be aware of it and to avoid it.

I haven't gone as far as sacrificing my sleep but there are times where if I'm free and she's not streaming, I would sometimes think of her like ""I wonder what she eats today"" or ""I hope she's doing fine"" something like that.

I do feel less emotionally attached to her when I busy myself with other things like watching anime, playing games, or just watch other vtubers. I was thinking about cancelling my membership too, but decided to keep it because I want to keep my privilege of spamming her :_heh: emote

hopefully gen2 doesn't have another girl-next-door type of vtuber lol I think that's really my biggest weakness";negative;;;;;
totally understandable. i remember i was SCing a bunch. stopped when she went into streaming overdrive. nowadays i usually just go for the archives and listen to them like podcasts when i have the chance, or leave a hi comment in the beginning of streams before leaving it in the background to do other stuff. a big help with not feeling that youre missing out for me at least was that in the fan discord they would have summaries for streams, like time tags for what happened, and would even archive unarchived streams (public ones). i fall in the category of vtubers replacing anime, essentially. the things i pay for would be membership and renting movies for watchalongs. though cheers for you since youre better off. if you ever do come back on, dont worry about the FOMO, just go at own pace;negative;;;;;
"Hey, sorry. I know this post is old, but I feel like I need to talk about what I'm dealing with, especially if it's with people that have had a similar story.

A few days ago or so I came across one of Projekt Melody's CB streams. It was... interesting. All I can really say is that something about hearing her voice when she was getting tipped had subconsciously made me feel attached in some way. 

I guess the only real way to explain it is that it sounded incredibly personal and intimate, since she would do this obviously fake voice, but then intermittently have this real sounding voice that seemed so genuine.

I've been battling depression ever since I lost my job two years ago. I've been feeling better, but right as I had a huge breakthrough this week in terms of working on projects and talking to people, I found her stream and, I dunno. I just literally can not stop thinking about her and it's fucking annoying.

I even decided to make an automatic scraper with yt-dlp so I don't miss her streams (and that OF requires a CC for free content, where her VODs are stored). I've watched people like Nyanners and have enjoyed her content, but I guess after having a tough breakup (which absolutely made me insecure about relationships and sex), seeing Melody on that stream made me attached. I literally could not stop thinking about her all day for the past few days.

This is still fresh as of this week and I'm dealing with it. I'm still figuring it out and I definitely need to talk to my therapist about it. 

It's just so frustrating because I didn't want this. I'm not blaming her because it's not her fault, but the fact that this happened is just so bizarre to me. I don't want to be so attached like this. It hurts a lot.

If anything, it's made me realize that the next step of my journey out of depression is probably making more friends and consistent relationships. I'm at least glad I can recognize this problem, but it hurts so much. I'm so frustrated and sad, frankly.";negative;;;;;
" At the end of the day, its important to realize it doesn't matter what happens I guess. You could stop watching their streams tomorrow and stop donating, and they wouldn't even notice you were gone at all. It's not bad to watch be inspired by vtubers per se, but when you've begun to watch vtubers for other reasons other than entertainment, you need realize what other things in your life you've substituted over them.

Totally this. We can of course like vtubers or streamers but not in an unhealthy way. At the end of the day, we can disappear and we'll never be noted, unless it's a small vtuber where they can remember you.";negative;;;;;
Maybe you did have one, but reading this you were just hyped about Amelia and you just calmed down over time. I've seen worse where people who have something important to do will stay up for a Vtuber stream and they've done it for months for multiple hololive members. I could be wrong but it's good to see you've disciplined yourself otherwise.;negative;;;;;
"I'm so thankful that Hololive members (from what I've seen) don't exploit people like that.

You see a lot of streamers (non-vtuber mainly) pretty much begging for donations. There was this one video of a streamer getting upset over not getting donations and shaming people for not donating.

But if someone like Korone started asking for money using a sob story, it would be incredibly dangerous.";negative;;;;;
I think the nature of VTubers does encourage an unhealthy obsession though. VTubers are (often) largely anonymous irl, and don't share deeply personal information about themselves. VTubers can graduate at any time for any reason, and you might just never hear from them again. With normal celebrities/streamers you have their name, face and other information that you can often use to check on what they're up to after they retire. It's much harder to do that with VTubers. I think this leads to many people treating their time with VTubers as more valuable than others, because you don't know when they will disappear.;positive;;;;;
There was a YouTuber who made daily vlogs that I used to watch all the time. I loved just listening to their stories. One thing that always scared me though was a commenter who would reply to everything that they said as if they were talking one on one, like this. ‚ÄúNice to see you again today, how are you? Yeah Im good. Oh no Im sorry that happened, I hope you feel better soon. Yeah Ive been doing that too. Okay see you tomorrow, bye‚Äù. They did that on every single video and the YouTuber never replied and said later they were dealing with a stalker problem at conventions. That kind of stuff terrifies me.;negative;;;;;
" I don't know if these people are just memeing or they actually think the streamer even knows who they are to care if they were not there or late.

Memeing mostly. It's an inside joke especially in streams like Rushia's or Korone's. Also there are many kids watching and thinks it's funny too (I think it's cringe). Not everything is creepy or wrong. What I think is a bigger problem is the white knights chat policing at every opportunity.

For chat policers: if you absolutely feel the urge to police the chat, tag the offender's name so that your message will be highlighted in orange in the offender's chat. Spamming ""stop spam"" or ""you know the rules and so do I"" etc. only pollutes the chat and chances are the original spammer won't even notice your messages. Not to mention you guys are also breaking the rules. Remember, RBI, don't fight spam with spam. I doubt white knights will see this message, but I just wanna rant.";negative;;;;;
the ‚ÄúHi sorry Im late‚Äù is fine because the girls (example Korone) can play off it but the latter is plain creepy.;negative;;;;;
Unfortunately they aren't always meming. I can't read Japanese, but from what I've heard the problem is even worse with the Japanese audiance because of how socially isolated the young adult male population tends to be.;negative;;;;;
"The latter would creep me out even if I become something with active online presence outside of vtubing.

But the former, that heavily depends on the actual stream itself. If you are late to join a stream that I have announced earlier that you are expected to be punctual (e.g. Viewer participation streams with early registrations and strict queue enforcement) , I expect an apology from you. Otherwise, I treat it as a non-standard greeting.";positive;;;;;
"Honestly, those don't seem TOO bad, although the second one is questionable. I have seen people sharing strange stories and making strange statements towards various Vtubers before, and it just makes me think ""why would you say that? What are they supposed to say to that? What are you expecting?"" I'm not sure I want the answers to those questions, although the best I can assume is that they just don't know any better and overshare.";negative;;;;;
" ""hi sorry I'm late"" or ""did you miss me""

Lol.. I thought I was the only one, whenever I see that I'm just like... oof, how is the streamer meant to react to that..? lol

I always try and stay very neutral whenever I type anything, sure you might become closer than just two total stranger, after a while talent will remember a user name or something but it's not like they honestly expect anybody to actually show up and wait for them lol

The chat can definitely become super cringe at times.";positive;;;;;
"I always worry about coming off like that in Pavolia Reine's chat. Me and a few others from her discord are repeat donators on her streams and I wouldn't be surprised if other regulars notice. I've had one person on Ame's discord say they recognize me and I've been in a NexatG clip. It doesn't help that a lot of the running gags with her superchats and donations are pickup lines.

It'd be all too easy to fall into a trap where I convince myself that Reine recognizes me or knows who I am. Or to think I have any sort of standing in the community because of it.";negative;;;;;
"Yeah, this one always comes off really weird to me when people in the chat say ""sorry I'm late I have to do my homework"" or ""I need to sign off now because I need to sleep/go"". It just comes off as try-hard attention grabbing.

Maybe I'm just irked since if the streamer address it, it'll just ruin the immersion of the game or whatever the streamer is doing. You can just come in and take off from their stream without having to tell what you were doing; it's literally none of their business.";negative;;;;;
I'm glad I am not the only one who thinks that way.;negative;;;;;
"You are going to get murdered by a dog.

(But I hope you are meming, if not, you might want to take a break from vtubers)";positive;;;;;
One time Hana Macchia tweeted that girl vtubers are just virtual e-girls and holy shit the amount of people who were actually pissed at her was disturbing.;negative;;;;;
"I think it's the purity of them.

You don't see the things that make them human. No acne, bed hair, no messy rooms, they can mute for coughing, etc. It's easy to forget that there is a real human behind the avatar.";neutral;;;;;
I see the same problem but with faceless youtubers (or those who will tease a face and not show it coughDREAMcough). The amount of people who would stand by them even in the face of hard numbers calling them a cheater, even outright saying they don't understand numbers and think they did no wrong, is disturbing. Honestly I could try connecting parasocial relationships and why people treat politics as sports teams.;negative;;;;;
"I disagree on the not inherently different part, to be honest. They can play round with their image much more than a regular streamer, that has just a webcam, and this allows them to market themselves in different ways that aren't possible for normal streamers. The fact that even some regular streamers like pokimane (and I heard lilypichu wants in too) have adopted a 2d avatar they ocasionally use tell there is some extra value to it.

I don't mean to say it is better or worse, and honestly I don't know the answer to that if that question were to be asked, because regular streamers are clearly still the most popular, but I do think it allows for different kind of content and the reasons should be very obvious.";negative;;;;;
"IMO, some vtuber fans probably dislike ""regular"" streamers due to how ""regular"", western streamers build up their own culture and the reputation that comes along with that.

From my perspective of a person that never got used to Twitch streamers. A few things stick out. Firstly, the chat seems to be emote spamming 24/7, making comments hard to read. Second, raiding is a common thing, which could be counted as disruptive. And third, the controversy about e-girl streamers that demand people to donate, despite not putting much (subjective) effort in their content. 

Those things alone is enough to turn me away from Twitch as a platform (and the ads as well).

Meanwhile, vtubers streaming culture is quite the opposite. With exception of a few (like Mea), vtubers do not demand money (or it's mostly done as a joke). Raiding is discouraged and is forbidden (same goes for being a pigeon). And the chat is more subdued and readable (with the occasional Ëçâ when something funny happens). 

There is clearly a big difference there between (the stereotype of) regular streamers and vtubers. And I could see how one could dislike or actively hate on the other.";negative;;;;;
Exept for eatingmiketysonsass, he's special;positive;;;;;
"Seeing the number of people wailing Aloe's name whenever Happy Synthesizer gets sang nowadays despite her barely even started streaming makes you wonder, really. 

I mean it's fine to see her as a victim of her circumstances but man some people treat her like a dead family member or something to that effect and it's honestly unsettling.";positive;;;;;
"It's a good video. CodeMiko also has a video that's where she reminded someone who donated that she isn't their girlfriend.

https://youtu.be/OCCxc-j_YVo

The big issue is that people don't like to be reminded of that. One of the biggest draws for streamers is to create an imaginary bubble for their viewers. For most of us we remain fully aware that it's fictional, but for some it's real to them. For instance the OK Boomer girl lost half her followers when she introduced her boyfriend; did the boyfriend change anything? No, but for some it was a painful reminder that the bubble wasn't real.";negative;;;;;
"This video reminded me of these Superchats that go ""I was going to suicide but you saved me"" or stuff like that, like one clip I saw of Watame. I get that some of the vtubers take it emotionally, but it probably also puts them in such an uncomfortable situation.";negative;;;;;
"Wow, that's an incredibly good video. It's pretty harsh in spots, but I feel should be required viewing. Honestly I'm starting to feel very conflicted right now, because I realize that despite knowing what a parasocial relationship is, I have been exhibiting a few signs of forming these parasitic relationships.

I have to remember that they don't know me, don't like me, and will never like me. I'm just part of a faceless mass that provides their livelihood. They only care about the support as far as it helps them monetarily, nothing more.";negative;;;;;
My issue with him in this video is toward the end. He spent the majority of the video telling his viewers  that hes not their friend, then 180 and tells them about buying ‚Äúbest friend coupons,‚Äù like what? Thats self defeating there.;negative;;;;;
I think about this from time to time as well. We only ever see Vtubers at their best (typically). They act nice for the camera, and they're funny and extremely personable. We never see them at their worst, and we honestly don't know their real personalities. Like you said, they could just be shaking their head and laughing at all of the people willing to drop $100 dollar super chats for some anime avatar they don't know on the internet. They could think we're all scum, but are just using us for monetary gain... We'd never know.;negative;;;;;
To be honest, after watching enough of them, you can kind of tell who might be that kind of person and who isn't. Won't name names but every vtuber lets part of their real selves leak at some point. Just pick your favorites wisely.;positive;;;;;
Hololive china incident certainly made me aware that vtuber may be laughing at you;positive;;;;;
"It really depends on what you see in the vtuber in question.

In my case, I see Niwarin and Futsuka as people that I deeply respect because they contribute to the Japanese freeware game scene in ways that no one else do. As such, I address them as with the senpai honorific almost every time. I was being poked fun by chat one time during Futsuka's stream, however.";neutral;;;;;
"Let's not forget that viewers can still create parasocial relationships with regular live-streamers, as well.             
Vtubers hit a new crowd that may not be as familiar with the consequences of such.";neutral;;;;;
"And there isn't anything wrong with dropping some money on a vtuber. Donating to the creator of your favorite entertainment is something I fully support and do for both vtubers and other YouTubers who produce content that I enjoy (like Tom Scott). But I'm not going to be spending more money that I would on another form of entertainment like a subscription or a game, dropping a red superchat is stupid unless you are rich and stable in life.

Sending a confession of love to a vtuber demonstrates that the person needs to reevaluate their parasocial relationship. And it's awkward for the vtuber, so if they actually understood and cared about the person they wouldn't put them on the spot like that.

Not to mention sending a confession to Kiara is a good way to get sent to hell by a certain tsundere Reaper.";negative;;;;;
"I can actually understand how someone can get to that point, I've thankfully never been that desperate, but I've been on the brink where I nearly gave up.

Go to college to get an expensive degree. Fail to find any sort of job with it, and go work a minimum wage job at a retail store to afford to pay off student loans. You can't pay rent anymore, so you move back in with your parents, and you've never formed any serious relationships with anyone in your life. You start to have a serious case of self-loathing, you hate yourself, and you start to just live vicariously, a lot of times your fantasies involve you being a completely different person. You play video games and read stories just to forget about how awful you feel everyday and how horrible your life is.

This is where I thankfully got my shit together, and started to climb my way out of this hole, and now while I'm not happy, I'm certainly in a better spot.

A lot of other people don't make it out though. They go deeper, some go join communities like the Red Pill, where they blame all of their problems on others. Some just become insanely depressed, while others find fulfillment and relationships from streamers. Kiara is actually a really easy one to fall into this trap with. She's incredibly genuine, and often says how much she loves her chat. She's not talking about them as individuals of course, but when you're starved for ANY attention, it's easy to fool yourself that she truly cares about you.

Honestly, I just feel bad for these people.";negative;;;;;
I remember this happened to Nene too, literally wrote her a love letter;negative;;;;;
I actually get it if someone donates a $100 and it's very rare for their name to pop up. Like sure that's cool to support in one big bomb instead of spreading it out. What scares me is when I see a name consistently in every stream doing multiple Red SC.;positive;;;;;
It's perfectly fine to have some attachment, it's just knowing when you are crossing the line into hurting yourself that matters. From your comment it seems like understand your own limits, so I think you are probably fine. It's the people who don't understand how deep they are who worry me.;positive;;;;;
"I agree on donating something to Coco. She has been protecting the rest of Hololive against the antis and she deserves a lot.

But I still hope people are using restraint when donating.";negative;;;;;
"So you're telling me ""eating mike tyson's ass"" isn't a real person's birth name you can form a real attachment with? I feel lied to.";negative;;;;;
I'm no pshychologist, but that sounds like a good start, yeah.  Take a break, and not just for a few days.;neutral;;;;;
"Watching their videos isn't going to solve whatever issues you are facing. It is only entertainment, do you get attracted to movie producers, the authors of books you read, the YouTube uploaders that you are subscribed to, etc.?

This isn't any different from that. It's fine to be a fan (we all are) but people take it too far and harm themselves. It's a matter of perspective.";positive;;;;;
I agree man, it is great to get a reflective moment like this every once in awhile.;positive;;;;;
Rushia is a millionaire in Brazil lol;positive;;;;;
"Indeed, its more about  the emotional investment.

If I had the money I wouldn't feel its wrong to support one of my oshis with a membership, but certainly I wouldn't be superchatting my wallet away even if I love their content.";negative;;;;;
"What would count?  I mean, are you just talking about physical goods?  

Way I see it, they are selling me/us something:  Entertainment.  If I weren't unemployed at the moment, I'd toss a fiver to a few different youtubers every now and again.";neutral;;;;;
Well I'd argue that it isn't just about money. It's also about time and emotional attachment.;negative;;;;;
"As a someone whose Hololive oshi is Ina, I feel somewhat obligated to respond to this comment.

The issue is not feeling some attachment (like, missing when she doesn't stream, for example), but the degree of attachment some people develop. It's okay to be someone's fan to like all/most of the content, the issue is when see the relationship as something more than only as viewer/streamer.";negative;;;;;
"Sure, but that's because you and I are not extreme cases. We understand that there is a real person underneath the avatar.

Many of the people with a serious parasocial relationship don't understand that.";negative;;;;;
Having empathy and purposefully deceiving them are different things.;positive;;;;;
You got it completely wrong, OP's saying to not see vtubers as your friend or lover, didn't you read the questions he made in the post ?;negative;;;;;
I'm not talking about just romantic relationships. Viewing vtubers as a friend is just as easy of a trap to fall into.;negative;;;;;
What brand of zipties do you recommend?;positive;;;;;
Tread carefully, that is called being a stalker;positive;;;;;
Eeeeesh;positive;;;;;
"The best question is: If you stopped watching, would it be like losing a friend?

Obviously everyone is somewhat attached so you would probably be a bit bummed out for the day, but ultimately you would move on and be fine. If you think it would seriously leave sad 24/7 for a longer period of time, then maybe you need to revaluate things.

My advice if you are worried about getting too attached is too not watch every stream. Missing a few will prevent you from feeling like you are their irl friend.";positive;;;;;
"The closer I look at the situation the more obvious to me it is that the Rushia fans are not the ones starting the controversy.

There were obviously a few actual Rushia fans upset, but the vast majority seemed fine. I started looking at the profiles of them and a large portion of the upset people either didn't post anything vtuber related before the incident or had even posted anti-vtuber stuff beforehand. It seems like they were just antis stirring the flames.

And then a lot of the drama people who were getting angry at the people where were upset or trying to illicit a response from Rushia fans were also antis or people who just disliked vtubers and wanted an excuse to complain about the fans. If you look at the comments of actual Rushia fans at the time of the incident you can see a huge number of comments mocking them and saying that they were losers.

Ironically there is very little evidence of the alleged relationship and if I had to guess I'd say it was probably not a real dating relationship. For example there were a bunch of pictures that people posted of them owning the same items in photos that were used as proof of them living together, but there were differences in the objects on closer inspection. The meaning of the message was badly translated (you can't just translate literally, you need to also translate implication and tone). And of course discord isn't used by couples in Japan, it's almost always Line that is used there for relationships. You cannot assume anything with just a single ambiguous message.";negative;;;;;
yes;positive;;;;;
This needs more upvotes, but this puts it perfectly;negative;;;;;
 you don't know what you're saying just stop it;positive;;;;;
"I wanted to involve the vtubers themselves in the discussion of parasocial relationship because most of them are average people just like us too. They learnt about vtubers, they became fan of it, and now they wanted to become a vtuber, hoping that they could also create a fun community in which they can feel like they belong.

Nothing wrong with that at all, of course. But just remember that one day your fans will move on from you. That one fan who always donated you $69? That one fan who always made cringy puns? That one fan who always encouraged you to continue when you failed your ukulele playing? One day you might not see them in your chat anymore. Or worse, they become your haters for something you said in the past, justified or not.";positive;;;;;
Speaking of ironmouse I keep hearing down the street that the discord is absolute cancer and the mods are powertrippers and that mouse isn't paying enough attention to their being weird. Any meat to those allegations?;negative;;;;;
lmfao nice joke that's probably what you want her to think instead of what she actually thinks.;positive;;;;;

"I don't think red-kun is her ""real voice"" she created it to be her ikemen voice, basically the handsome man voice.
Haachama is haachama, don't think too deeply about what she does or you'll go crazy.";negative;;;;;
Haachama has always been pretty open about her real life - moreso than most vtubers, but still less than people streaming under their own identity. I think she has a pretty clear understanding of the chat/streamer relationship and knows exactly what she's doing there though.;negative;;;;;
Haachama-chama has been very open about issues she has had to face in her life, her struggles and hardships. As for Red-kun, it is most likely her trying to do an 'attractive' male voice.;negative;;;;;
"I love it when vtubers change their voice to something different or whispers and audiance goes wild on ""real voice"" train. Chill your tits.";positive;;;;;
I think everything Haachama does is pretty measured and under control, even if none of it feels like it, so I'm not too worried about her lol;negative;;;;;
"Haatochama is the strongest big brain zoomer streaming right now. Talented enough to honestly confuse viewers like you.

I wouldn't worry about her.";positive;;;;;
i do not think showing off your real voice as a vtuber is to far at all.;negative;;;;;
Come on, don't make me elaborate on those too..;negative;;;;;
Oof;positive;;;;;
What if you don't have any of those?;negative;;;;;
Exactly, and while friendships can be made over the internet it's important to keep perspective and not to obsess.;neutral;;;;;
lol ur preaching to a whole crowd of lonely losers;positive;;;;;
If you're forming an emotional attachment to a vtuber, doesn't that mean a parasocial relationship is already forming though? Lately I've been trying to consciously make sure I stay emotionally detached, to avoid unnecessary risks.;negative;;;;;
We all need only one kidney, to be honest... And few other organs can function just as well partially removed!;negative;;;;;
"I was able to watch her streams all the time when she first debuted since she streamed only few hours(1-2)at a time, so it was easy to watch the archive if I missed streams. When her schedule became more heavier and she started streaming for 5 hours or more, it became impossible to keep up with every stream she did. 

I guess overtime I sorta lost interest + she never directly responded to any comments I made(didnt get any direct attention) so I gradually stopped watching her streams.
I didnt send her any superchats, but if I did I think I would have watched her a bit longer.
I realized I was getting way too emotionally invested in her streams, specially when she cancelled them or changed her schedule. (Probably because I was sacrificing sleep just to watch her streams)

I also realized that the person behind the avatar has her own life and that no matter what I did, I would never be able to interact with her or make any meaningful connection with her. I was just another picture on her screen commenting in her chat or streams.";negative;;;;;
True, I think it would be way harder to break a parasocial relationship with a small indie vtuber that only gets a few viewers on her streams. With less viewers, you would probably have a greater impact just by donating or chatting and youd probably feel like the streamer relies on you a lot more compared to vtubers with thousands of viewers.;positive;;;;;
"I'm also guilty of crushing on Ame. And, judging from OP and these comments, it seems like it's a real trend with her lol. 


I think it's like you said. She has a real girl-next-door vibe. I kinda forget I'm watching a vtuber or streamer, and feel like I'm listening to a close friend. I don't think I've felt that way with any other vtuber before. I believe it's something intrinsic to her appeal, and I don't even think she realizes it herself. 


What's good, and maybe the only reason I haven't went completely nuts for her yet, is she seems to keep a specific distance from her chat and fans. Unless she's reading SC, she never directly refers to anyone in chat by name or calls out to anyone specifically other than staff or other vtubers. She doesn't single anyone out and always talks to her chat as a whole. She also rarely interacts with us directly through like games or such. I almost feel like she doesn't trust us, which is fair given how bad her chat can get. 



 I think the closest Ame has to get there is Walfie, who drew the chibi Ame that's in memes all the time.  But I think Walfie keeps it professional, which is why she's comfortable with mentioning him. Other than that, it's not like Gura, Calli, or Kiara's chat where you can hear regulars names being called out frequently. I think Ame loses out on a lot of potential SC and viewers that way, but I don't think she cares. 



On the other-hand, she's painfully adorable in her membership community posts. I would be lying if a highlight of my evening, is getting a random community posts from her like she can't sleep or some fish video she found. Some members in the comments have equated it to getting a text from your girlfriend randomly. It's really dumb, but in the case of Ame I don't think it's entirely untrue.";negative;;;;;
"Your story's almost the same as mine. Even the part with archiving streams with yt-dlp(when I used to archive streams it was just yt-dl a year ago) is eerily similar to what I did. I probably had around 400GB of her VODs saved on my PC at that time. 

You should probably delete your saved VODs and backups if you have any. I would recommend unfollowing her on any social media you might have and to not watch any of her streams, if you have any paid subscriptions I'd recommend you cancel them too. 

Distancing yourself from any vtubers for the meantime would also be a good idea, when I stopped my parasocial relationship with Amelia I pretty much stopped watching vtubers and streamers for almost six months. I still watch them now but I don't feel the need to catch-up with everything they do nor do I get FOMO anymore. 

I'm just going to type my thoughts out from hereon. I was in a bad place at the time when I made the previous comment, and watching her streams was my outlet for negative emotions when things got too hard. It was just like having a friend available to you 24/7, and it was one way relationship where you didn't have to put any effort in. Your brain starts to trick you into believing that you have actual relationships with people you've never met before. 

It's been a year now but I think the combination of both the ""safe environment"" of streams and the friendly personality of most vtubers is what enables people to develop parasocial relationships with streamers. The moment when I ""woke up"" and became free of my parasocial relationship is when Amelia cancelled her NieR:Automata playthrough, I remember being so upset and angry that she decided to not continue my favorite game. It was then realized that I stopped watching her streams because I found them entertaining, and I was watching them just to keep up my parasocial relationship with her. It sort of broke this perfect, idealized image I had of her (which is probably something that people in parasocial relationships have or had for any vtuber and streamer). 

This must be a lot to say to someone you've never met, but I hope that you and anyone else who might read this realize why and how parasocial relationships develop and how they might impact your life negatively. I now just treat streamers and vtubers as entertainment and not as friends, I turn off the streams when I get bored and do something else. This [post I saw on Twitter](https://i.imgur.com/WEYuOs4.png) is probably the most relevant thing to this topic; fans of vtubers have to remember that there are real people behind the avatars with their own lives, and just like them, you have to live your own life too even though it might be painful. I hope my little essay helps you and anyone else who might be feeling this way.";negative;;;;;
I'm curious if for hololive if that's something they inherently avoid, or if it's a company mandate not to press too hard on donations (which  they don't need to press much since they're practically superchats go brrrrrrrrrrrrr);negative;;;;;
Frankly I rarely see the streamers begging for money, those videos are far and few because those people don't often get a spotlight( for the better I am greatful they dont). Non-Vtuber or Vtuber I care less, I just want to enjoy what I'm watching and I dabble in both worlds because they bring something unique to the table.;negative;;;;;
"I don't know - honestly the idea of checking up on a celebrity after they retire because you know their face and name (putting it on them to control their public footprint even after leaving) already sounds pretty creepy to me. It means a celebrity can never really return to being a normal, private citizen, like they permanently gave up a bit of their personhood the moment they chose to be an entertainer. VTubing just puts the inherent weirdness of fame on full display.

The idea that someone could want to follow a celebrity into their retirement, or could fear losing contact with that celebrity after retirement so much that they get more obsessed, is exactly why the hardstop of the avatar is so appealing to streamers. That VTubers can disappear isn't the problem - that people could want to chase into someone's private life is. This isn't specific to the nature of VTubers.";negative;;;;;
"Stalkers happens time to time, you see it sometimes with the larger YouTubers, they make random videos like ""some guy showed up at the house to greet us""

"Oh dude, I completely get it, I see someone like this in Hololive all the time.

Maybe I am just being an as\\\\\ (completely possible, sometimes I feel kinda guilty of thinking ill tbh), but there is this person who always posts these really long, really elaborate, incredibly well written ""thanks for the stream"" paragraphs in every stream (or most at least) of one of the branches of Holo.

Maybe it's just a person who is just a really dedicated fan and happens to be an amazing writer that can come up with such majestic messages without even blinking, but it always leaves me thinking.";negative;;;;;
Just ignore, block, and report honestly;positive;;;;;
That reminds me of the Towa incident, which shows that gachikois are the living embodiment of parasocial relationships;neutral;;;;;
"Would you not see a simple 'I missed you!' as a compliment? It shows you've now got regulars who look forward to your content, not necessarily that they emotionally felt a hole in their lives. 

For example, I miss live sport. I like going to the stadiums and feeling the atmosphere of other fans around me. I don't think it would be inappropriate to tell another season ticket holder whose face a recognised that I 'missed' them. In this context I'm just trying to convey the sense that I enjoy sharing company with other like-minded people who I hadn't seen for a while.";negative;;;;;
"the ""Did you miss me"" line is definitely one of the worst ""seemingly normal"" things chat can say, I just can't see how anybody wins this.

The talent can't just say something like ""who are you?"" ""nope not really"" because, well you know..

But saying ""yes I did!"" just invites more people to do it and gives an unrealistic expectation.

People just need to be normal ~~~~~~ :(";negative;;;;;
They don't seem too bad on their own but it does come across as strange to me. I've never had problems with parasocial relationships so I don't really know if this is just people being socially awkward and don't know what makes sense to say in chat, or it is a reflection of what this thread is talking about with these people actually thinking the streamer understands and cares about their personal life. It is just something I seen and thought it might be related.;negative;;;;;
"Well saying ""I'm late"" isn't really a big, ""Did you miss me?"" is on a different level (said unironically, of course)";neutral;;;;;
"I dunno, if it's a smaller streamer and especially if the viewer is a regular, it makes a bit of sense, since in smaller chats, the streamer can recognize and address individual names more easily, and thus the chat experience is a little more personal. Speaking of personal, it might just be me, but in streams with double-digit viewers and lower chat activity, I kinda feel bad just leaving without a word if I was active before.

Edit: A word";positive;;;;;
"I'm guilty of doing this with smaller streamers. I don't do it to get attention, but because I don't want the streamer to lose their confidence or anything. 
It's like this, I don't want my leaving to make them think ""Oh, they probably left to watch another streamer"" or ""Are they leaving because I said something wrong?"" Don't get me wrong, I know how little of an impact just me leaving has, but if multiple people leave without saying something at similar times, it could cause self doubt, especially with small streamers.
The same could be said about late joining. It's like saying ""I'm not leaving/late because of you, but because of something I really need to do that's important, so don't worry about it.""

There's probably a better way to explain this, but this is all my brain could do.";negative;;;;;
"Hmmm... Depends on the streamer/chat culture I think. I have been guilty of doing this in a stream before ( addressed to both chat and the Vtuber) because its a smaller stream and the Vtuber themselves don't mind it. If it bothers peeps I'd like them to say it to me straight though and I'll stop.

To an extent it is for attention I think, the occasional bye XXX or Hi XXX is a nice feeling to have especially when ya a regular. That being said I ain't gonna be throwing a fit if I'm not noticed or responded to. 

I understand ya reasoning but I feel like it's a bit much to restrict or have a rule such that people shouldn't be able to say a greeting or a ""bye"" when they leave because its technically none of chat or the vtubers business that this individual person is leaving or arriving. 

Well...  that's just kinda how I feel about it though. I'll try my best not to do so in future but I probably won't discourage others from saying such remarks if I see em either.";negative;;;;;
"In smaller vtubers channels I frequent (double digits), I do say things like that.

It's a small channel, and the audience hasn't changed that much over time so, both the vtuber and the viewers recognize each others names at this point. I see it as merely common courtesy to not only the vtuber but the rest of chat.

You could compare it to talking to your guildmates in a MMO or saying to people in your classroom or workplace.

I could just come and go without saying anything, but I see it as pointlessly cold and distant, if I am in a chat room I might as well chat with people. I'd honestly feel bad if I didn't.

It's not the same being a name in an anonymous sea of spam than being someone the other person has some degree awareness of.";negative;;;;;

Yeah, for sure it differentiates the market. But Im talking in terms of like the value of them as human beings. I see a lot of vtubers fans that just like to shit on ‚Äúregular‚Äù streamers as if theres something inherently wrong with regular streaming that is not present in vtubing when in reality its just based on the same tired ‚ÄúI am special and have a very different taste‚Äù sort of bullshit.;negative;;;;;
"This is exactly what I mean, not only is that absolutely not the point, people dont realize that this is mostly a wildly inaccurate overgeneralization and some nonsense miscategorization of it being ‚Äúwestern‚Äù, a lot of is just natural differences between platforms and taste. Imagine how much hate a person would get in this sub or r/hololive for saying ‚ÄúI dont like vtubers, their voices are made up and I think its annoying‚Äù, its as arbitrary as ‚ÄúI dont like raiding, its disruptive‚Äù. Raiding is a built in feature that a lot of people like on Twitch, its just another way of interacting and supporting different streamers. 

Theres nothing wrong with prefering Vtubers, people are going to like different things thats so obvious it might as well be a non statement, but one is not inherently better than the other.  Their value as human beings are the same. People get so invested in building their identity around the things they like that they cant see that and become incredibly defensive when called out. Thats what Im trying to get at, a particular Vtuber fans feelings towards Vtuber A is not inherently more genuine that the feelings of a particular fan of Regular Streamer B or Musical Artist C. That kind of thought pattern is delusional and indicative of an unhealthy parasocial relationship.";negative;;;;;

Thankfully nowadays on the Hololive subreddit there's starting to form a massive backlash against people who make posts like that. It's fucking ridiculous that 6 months later, after she had only THREE streams, she's still being mentioned. If they seriously gave a shit, they'd find out what she's doing now and go follow her there.;negative;;;;;
"ikr. Aloe is not dead. the fans really need to chill out about her retirement. I've followed 1 Streamer and 1 Youtuber who is actually DEAD when they are still making videos/content. and it FUCKING SUCK. but this? Bloody hell, you guys (those fans) overreacting.

man. This is the reason why I hardly cried in movies or anime at all. I knew it just acting/Not Real. so why bother being emotionally invested? thanks to my mother who always said ""never being emotionally attached to anything or someone because it can ruin your life once they're gone"" is actually helping me to get through any relationship and always makes a barrier between reality and fantasy";negative;;;;;
I get this, I mean Aloe can symbolize lost oppportunities, she could probably have had an amazing career if the continued, and I sincerely think its a shame she graduated, but I find odd how some people just won't let go of it. She streamed like what, 4 times?;negative;;;;;

"Some people can't effectively differentiate between fictional works and reality. I'd imagine that for Vtubers, this problem effects more people due to the blend of the character and the personality of the person behind it, making it more difficult for more people to make that differentiation.

"The big issue is that people don't like to be reminded of that

and yet still they act like they own them.";negative;;;;;
I get you, I really hate when people push such topics onto the streamers;negative;;;;;
"  They only care about the support as far as it helps them monetarily, nothing more.

I mean, don't get me wrong here, money is probably the largest part of interest to 99% of streamers, but it's not the only reason.

Some streamers really do enjoy the interaction with the chat, having a community to share things with, etc etc. But chat isn't a real friend, not even an internet friend. to that point it's true.
As chat we are.. not even sure how to word it, just not a friend in the true sense.";negative;;;;;
"You jump from unhealthy one extreme ""vtubers are actual friends"" to the other unhealthy (and cynic) extreme of ""vtubers only want your for money"".  (I am not saying there are no such vtubers out there, just like with any person, you will find those too).

The statement isn't any less wrong from saying musicians only play music for money, singers only sing for money or actors just act on stage for money. Or anybody who has any sort of careering ""only does it for money"".

Most vtubers legitimately enjoy vtubing, interacting with their audiences, having a nice chat, and enjoy performing before an audience that appreciates what they do, and of course are happy and would like to make a living out of it. And that's absolutely fine.";negative;;;;;

I've even seen two people while watching live how the SC msg (multiple, each time, at least $200 each) saying how the talent saved his life, he was thinking of killing himself and such. You also see clips of the JP hololive girls getting them too.

I get people might want to express thanks but I always found that a few steps to far, personally. That's such a personal thing for the viewer and it's such a heavy topic for the talent with zero room to wiggle. Say one wrong word and it can end badly.

I think things like that are best kept out of it. or at the very very least, written in a letter and sent in via mail, so the talent can read and process it themselves and if they won't to bring it up on stream later if they wish.";positive;;;;;

Thanks for replying. Logically I know the relationship is just an entertainer and a viewer. However I can't control the way I feel. I don't talk that much to other people irl right now, and, well, you start becoming attached to people whose  voice you hear often, even if they're not talking to you specifically. You start taking specific things they say more seriously than you should or think about how they're doing outside of streams. Anyway, I'm aware of it and spoken to people about it, so... I'm working on a healthier outlook. For now, ignoring chat and watching more VODs seems to help. I hope I won't have to stop watching her streams since I do enjoy them.;negative;;;;;
Then don't;neutral;;;;;
"I'm pretty confident I'd move on and be fine of one of the Hololive talents I like were to graduate, but I've managed to ""move on and be fine"" from losing contact with multiple actual IRL friends (or at least, people I thought can be called friends...) in the past owing to frequent moving of living place, so this doesn't actually do much to quell my worries.

I do miss streams very often (I think Amelia's lets play of Super Mario Galaxy was the only time I ever cared much about catching everything in a series) so I guess I'm not in too much danger, but even then I find I somewhat care or worry when I hear of something happening to/with one of Hololive's talents.

There are plenty more but you get the idea. I can't tell if they truly are trolls but if they aren't, then they are wasting their time. This is what I found as a sad display.

Upon closer looks, most fans of Rushia from Japan are indeed fine and they never started the controversy, you were right. It was the ""weebish"" fans, more likely antis or perhaps trolls, who stirred up such events.

I'd think this could become one of those double-parasocial relationship issues that was discussed elsewhere in the thread, where the vtuber ends up thinking that one active-from-the-start guy is more important despite knowing nothing of them;negative;;;;;
"I'll add to that, you can actually communicate with smaller vtubers in a meaningful way, which make the parasocial relationship belief worse.

A streamer with +5000 viewers rarely react to an a particular user message, its almost a stroke of luck almost if they catch it in the sea of spam. Now in a chat with 50 viewers, the vtuber often has time to at least read every message and reply to as well.

In Twitter, smaller vtubers are more likely to answer to regular viewers while bigger vtubers hardly do.";positive;;;;;
Is it still parasocial if its small enough? The one sidedness kinda fades away at really tiny numbers. I follow a pretty small vtuber (usually around 75 viewers), and while I dont really interact all that much I see her recognize regular chat members and talk to them a lot. At what point does it just become a two-way freindship through the internet? I mean obviously people should still be careful about becoming too dependent on that relationship but still.;negative;;;;;
" I think it's like you said. She has a real girl-next-door vibe. I kinda  forget I'm watching a vtuber or streamer, and feel like I'm listening to  a close friend. I don't think I've felt that way with any other vtuber  before. I believe it's something intrinsic to her appeal, and I don't  even think she realizes it herself. 

While I don't personally watch her beyond the occasional clip, I can definitely see this vibe through said clips and the way her fans would sometimes describe her. 

I think what helps is that, even with just a casual look at her overall persona, you can see that she might just be the most relatable one out of all the HoloEN girls. There are factors about her that would probably make her resonate more with the average viewer.";negative;;;;;

But on your other point where you said you think people say stuff like ""I am special and have different taste"" I think it is a bit too far fetched. 

I am not sure if you are familiar with subreddits like leagueoflegends but I'll use it as an example. In that subreddit there is always a celebrity(usually some journalist) that says stuff like ""oh but the reddit perception about this particular topic was X"" and then if you do the social experiment of looking at entire threads checking all most upvoted comments usually no one said that thing that the celebrity or journalist said. Because they read a few one off comments and assumed a few things, they thought the entire community had a line of thinking that they didn't really have. What I am trying to say with this example is that these type of comments have a lot of generalizations and if you were to actually go check real discussions, maybe youtube comments or maybe stream chats you wouldn't find people like that very easily.";positive;;;;;
"Overgeneralization is a thing that everyone does. People wil form their own opinions, from both personal preferences and bias.

The point of the post is to clarify why some people think one is better than the others. You can't expect everyone to like everything.

For example, a car that is modified to be loud and obnoxious will worth inherently less than the same car that has a clean and well polished look. And of course, this is my personal opinion, and it's worth is the same as any other opinion piece.

Although I do agree that some people get overly attached no matter the type of media they consume, it's the same thing for all media since the beginning of time.";positive;;;;;

"I think the laughing type of people that he mentions are probably a minority. There are so many examples of streamers who had or have all sorts of mental problems like depression or anxiety and started streaming for all sorts of different reasons, like they were lonely or had they a fucked up life and needed an escape... 

I've been watching streamers ever since the end of justin tv and I believe, especially now with people being more open about mental health, there is honestly strong evidence out there to say this is the kind of job that attracts a certain personality type and it is kinda of content made by dejects for dejects. (English is not my main language. Should I have used the word rejects here?)

A lot of the people involved in it (both viewers and streamers) grew in a generation where being nerds or being into games wasn't cool and they never fit anywhere but now there is an entire community around the streaming phenomenum and otaku culture so no wonder some of them develop strong attachments if they never had something like it before.";negative;;;;;

" I think the difference is the medium that the specific viewer and the VTuber are communicating with. 

If the viewer and that VTuber is only interacting on stream, it is still a parasocial relationship since on stream, the VTuber is mainly creating content for the masses even when the VTuber is talking about a specific viewer.

If that VTuber is having a private chatroom with one or more of their fans, I think it will cross the line of having an actual two-way relationship since the VTuber is not creating content, but chatting with the specific fans like friends. I think the important aspect of a two-way relationship is that both sides need to have a somewhat equal position.";negative;;;;;
You can enjoy someone's content, you can talk to them about stuff and they might support you and/or console you, but calling that a friendship is not correct IMO.;positive;;;;;

That clip is gold though ~ 10/10

Edit: I'm surprised she hasn't gotten more subs btw, she's a super chill streamer that is easy to just sit and listen to.";negative;;;;;
Agreed;positive;;;;;
I've been personally guilty of writing messages like that, I'd say that those are less directed to the Vtuber and more to the rest of the audience, trying to fit in there as a new regular. They may be directed to the Vtuber itself just to assure being remembered, though.;negative;;;;;
"I pretty much exclusively watch smaller VTubers, and can often be quite active in the chat. A fair few remember me by name and seem happy to interact with me. If I need to go for any reason, I'll usually drop a quick message just so they know I didn't leave because I was bored or something. Being in the UK means a lot of JP morning streams start at around 11pm, so I'll maybe just say ""Thank you for the stream, I have to go now! Goodnight/bye!"". I'd rather have a few people think I want attention than potentially upset a streamer by just going from being active in the chat to completely gone.

If I'm late I sometimes say sorry for that, because again, for a smaller streamer I think it could be upsetting if some of their regular viewers don't show up. I never give a full explanation or anything, just a ""Hi, sorry I'm late!"" and then things are go.

I think the important thing to remember about parasocial relationships is that they're not all made equal. Some cases are very bad, some aren't. If you're a fan of a big streamer it's going to be hard to engage, but if you watch someone who doesn't get as many viewers and engages a lot more with chat, then yes, you can probably have a nice friendly chat with them, as long as you remember that it isn't a 'real' in-person friendship.";negative;;;;;

"I dont mean they literally say that, but it is the mentality they have in their head. In my experience, which is mostly the Hololive fandom, YouTube comments are way worse in this regard than the sub. The sub will sometimes passive aggressively imply it but there are people willing to call them out. The example I mentioned in my first comment is from one of the top comments in Towas cover of Error with thousands of likes on it. 

Theres always an underlying sense of elitism, in the earlier days it was with comments in foreign languages, then Twitch terminologies, and so on and so forth. People just get way too invested and they start to internalize being a fan way too much into their identity.";negative;;;;;
"That is not what inherent value is, a persons inherent value is intersubjective not subjective. Its not about which is more enjoyable to any particular person. No ones blaming you for liking Vtubers more, thats not the point, but the validity of you liking Vtubers isnt worth more than some rando liking another streamer or, in the example I mentioned, other musical artists.

Overgeneralization is a thing people do sure but its not a good thing to do and especially not if its an inaccurate basis for your argument. You argue against BS but your whole arguments relies on a BS and still manages to completely miss the point. Imagine if some dude in LSF goes around saying ‚ÄúAll Vtubers have annoying made up voices‚Äù, it amounts to the same argument as the one your making. If truth doesnt matter because ‚Äúeverybody overgeneralizes‚Äù then no conversation can go anywhere. But Ill make this clear, this is an entirely different argument. 

And again youre free to dislike whatever, Im not arguing for the merits of a Twitch streamer. It is not the act of enjoying Vtubers more that is the problem, I subjectively will value my average enjoyment of them higher than the average Twitch streamer, but their inherent value as human beings, and therefore the standard that I would treat them as such through a moral framework, is the same.";negative;;;;;
Me, I dont like specially attention seekers;negative;;;;;
"It's all good, I'm sure there are some people who seek only money from this ""job"" they found, it's impossible to have a 100% user base without bad apples.

As viewers, we all need to understand that at the end of the day, it's just an escape for us, purely entertainment.

They can leave and never come back at any time, and they won't even think of us. (for the most part, 99% of people don't matter)";negative;;;;;
Rejects would fit more, I never see anyone say dejects, just 'dejected';positive;;;;;
Rejects or outcasts would work.;neutral;;;;;
It has nothing to do with Coco. It was Spade echo only that got things leaked about how she talked badly about the fans.;negative;;;;;
But what if I really want to eat Mike Tyson's ass ?;negative;;;;;
I think this is mostly right, but I'm a small vtuber on twitch just getting a couple of viewers during my stream, and it doesn't feel parasocial, it's just forming connections on the internet and making friends, as pretty much all of us have done. But yes if you have hundreds or thousands of viewers I could see it being parasocial for the viewer, and certainly being a streamer can have pitfalls as well.;negative;;;;;
"Because not having all their streams monetized can be easily correlated to not pushing for Superchats as hard as they did before?

It's not like there's an exact, stable flow of donation revenue that needs to be donated every month. It can and will always fluctuate. Disabling SCs for a few streams will very likely result in a decrease in SC revenue.";negative;;;;;
Tbh, chat as a whole is rarely creepy in any Vtuber stream. You can get banned if you're not careful. On social media and anonymous forums is where the controversies always live. The only exception I know of is Coco's anti spam.;positive;;;;;
Oh, I thougt it was 500 million not billion. Soon Elon could only afford about 35.;negative;;;;;
Again we are full on Poe's Law here.;positive;;;;;
Got some bad news for ya buddy..;positive;;;;;
Personally, as long as tyson's ass doesn't use this attention he's got for something unrelated to vtubers in general, I'll close both eyes. His gimmick provides some entertainment value, at least.;neutral;;;;;
"A literal ton of stuff happened during the Holo China incident. And the poster literally mentioned the ""Hololive China incident""";positive;;;;;
huh, didn't think about that, just thought that those who would have sent akasupas will just keep them for the day and send them for an even bigger red chat once it comes on again.;neutral;;;;;
Aren't the only channels to not monetized the ones who are at odds with Youtube like Suisei? (And also Sora I think, but she doesn't want memberships in YT because she already has in Nico);negative;;;;;
The world will never know if I'm serious or not!   Jokes aside though if having a crush on a vtuber makes some people happy then I don't see a problem with it.  2020 was rough for a lot of people and I'm sure vtubers helped to save many depressed peoples' lives.   It only really becomes a problem if they become stalkers.  Otherwise live and let live I say l;neutral;;;;;
A channel can be monetized while having specified streams/videos be unmonetized.;neutral;;;;;
"Okay thanks, was very 50/50 on where you were on the matter.

But yes, the problem is how far it gets internalized, to the point of causing serious problems .";positive;;;;;
Ahh I get it, I misunderstood, I was thinking of channels rather than individual streams.;negative;;;;;
"I feel this is just your subjective experience. Normal streamers too have rabid fanbases who think their heros can't do anything wrong. Parasocial relationships aren't really unique to vtubers either. But yes, criticism of holos usually isn't well received.

Either way, the two main reasons for this reaction boils down to two points in my opinion:

* The holos are entertainers foremost. People watch them for their personalities and interactions, not for the amazing gameplay, which is the main stock of the normal streams. So the fandom reacts to criticism about their gameplay/choice of games mostly with ""Why don't you just let them play what they want to play?"".          
I haven't really seen the zatsudan get criticized, so I can't offer insight on that one, but I assume the general reception would be the same.

* The other sides of their activities, the singing, is sacrosanct. The holos are idols after all, and a big part of such a fandom is cheering them on in their growth. Anybody complaining about song choice or lack of variety will get dogpiled.";negative;;;;;
"

An example can be:  
  
Rushia playing the role of a gf to their viewers

Seems like you want to prove your tesis by triggering the Fanded.

Anyway it largely depends from the platform, it's hard to voice unpopular opinions on reddit without getting downvoted to hell but there is no shortage of criticism both fair and batshit crazy in places like 5ch/4chan including dedicated hate threads and such.

Many Vtubers, especially the JP ones go out of their way not to offend anyone and respect their audience but as we know they are often faced with strong negativity every time they make a mistake, someone made inproper joke, someone laughed too much from a joke, someone was ""too new"" to sing that song etc. no wonder some people get defensive when even seemingly minor thing might blow out and push your favorite into a hiatus.";negative;;;;;
I disagree ... Looking at how many vtubers had their careers ruined or faced severe harassment, for the most stupid and pitiful reasons, they are far from privileged. Aloe was bullied into graduation for a really small mistake - some leaked personal Twincast  video in which she was talking about another vtuber's reason for retirement, that some saw as spreading rumors ... so stupid, yet she got doxxed for it, lost her dream job, and had to go under for months from her other activities online too. There was another vtuber during that time, that faced similar harassment for leaking an IP by mistake ... she was an indie, she was growing fast 138k subs, and she is on hiatus since August as a result. Roa from Nijisanji saw severe backlash and harassment due to being presented by Narukami's fake news as a bully who harassed another Vtuber into retierment, even thou all the conversations leaks pointing to nothing of the sorts, and no evidence existing - in the end her innocence was proven, but Roa is still on hiastus 3 months later. Amatsuka Uta, an indie with exceptional growth, exceeded 300k in a month, some artists did a commission in the past for her, and he remembered that he wasn't paid his ... 15 USD 2 months later, and despise contacting her and her apologizing and paying him, he leaked the conversations to Narukami, and as a result the harassment started, all sort of conspiration theories have been built around her, and she has been silent for 2 weeks. Towa faced harassment for forgetting her mic one and some mans voice being heard. Coco ... should I tell her story? You know what all those have in common thou? They are not harassed by their fanbase. Most of the time they are anti's and haters, that specifically wait for the smallest vulnerability to go after and destroy a vtuber. And too many times it works.... sometimes it even makes her lose fans ... just look at Kizuna Ai, to this day she didn't recover after the rumors that she was replaced by a different actress.  Let's compare those controversies with some surrounding real female streamers... Remember that time when that female Twitch streamers started to scream and shame her viewers for not donating or subscribing to her? When she faced backlash for it, she simply said that it's all a role and she plays a character ... and she got forgiven for everything. Such examples are countless... Look at the Logan brothers, they made millions of antisocial assholes, and no matter how much disrespect they have shown to other cultures and how big pieces of shit are they keep growing in subs, and Youtube protects them ... meanwhile, Mel gets demonetized and banned for having boobs, and Marine for simply breathing. Generally YouTubers and Streamers grow and prosper on the back of drama and prosperity... so much, that they manufacture drama, and feuds to get attention .... I cry when I remember the ol' times of YouTube when creators simply did collab with each other, and what beautiful results that brought, Meanwhile a vtuber can be destroyed by the smallest mistake or error ... and that's why their fans are so protective and reject criticism ... and to be fair, what valid criticism is there for Hololive thou? 'Appealing to pedophiles, creeps and male gaze? They are played by males with voice changers? They are cringe? They are sexualized cartoons?' Those are insults, not criticism.;negative;;;;;
"I dont really notice any difference relative to other streamers to be honest. Every fanbase will have their crazy fans that react negatively to any criticism, even if it is constructively given.

That being said, I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to point out with your example.";negative;;;;;
Just like any personality/ celebrities? Go to any sports team forum and shit talk/criticize their best players, you're going to get the same treatment, even worse...;positive;;;;;
"I don't know how things are there these days, but 5+ years ago there were plenty of twitch streamers with zero tolerance for criticism. Claiming it's somehow a V only thing is a mystery to say the least.

More specifically in Holo's case, there's god knows how many man-years of streaming experience in that outfit. It seems rather presumptuous to think a random schmuck off the Internet is going to have anything of value to say about their content.";negative;;;;;
You can criticize them but it has to be constructive, there have been posts talking about the parasocial relationship aspect that comes with watching vtubers.;neutral;;;;;
I just think that parasocial relationship in at least hololive is more encourage;neutral;;;;;
To add more context to the Meiro / Roa controversy, Narukami did end up saying that both of the girls were at fault and it was Nijisanji management to blame for it ending up the way it did. He's a piece of shit, but he's the only one that reports on the fucked up things that happen in the vtuber industry.;negative;;;;;
Criticism of actions from say twitch streamer have more positive reaction than a vtuber criticism (even valid ones);positive;;;;;
Some foster it, but I don't think any do it as a planned business move. After all, it cuts both ways. A few holos like Watame are outright emotionally dependent on their members. They couldn't live without streaming and interaction with their fanbase anymore.;negative;;;;;
He basically just tried to push the blame out of him and do damage control. Roa did nothing wrong. Narukami presented screenshots with conversations in which Roa was begging Meiro to talk instead of going through the management and told her she didn't ask for her to change her accent, as Roa bullying Meiro. In the end it was discovered that Meiro had a past history with plagiarism and lied about her accent being something she was born with it, yet the heat remained on Merio.;negative;;;;;
Damn I totally agree with you using Watame as an example. I literally always see her cry everytime I visit her when it's time for SC reading.;positive;;;;;
I don't know about that, perhaps Meiro was a menhera after all but Roa should've really drop that accent issue and just ignore her, especially since Meiro didn't use it all the time. If it was so obvious that she's not at fault she wouldn't be on hiatus ever since, although to be fair I think she already [apologized on twitter](https://twitter.com/yuzuki_roa/status/1318912752413364224) for dragging this thing untill it backfired against the whole company (rather than to Meiro).;negative;;;;;
